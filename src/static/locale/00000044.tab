c001_interest	That's a succubus\trade secret ♥
c001_like	Here I go!
c001_love	You need to be\a little more mature...
c001_profile	The leader of the succubi. Much about her remains a mystery.\Though she generally loves to flirt and tease, you can also tell when she means business. In stark contrast to her usual easygoing manner, she is utterly meticulous when it comes to preparing for battle.\Having grown up in the center of the Infernal Realm, she often finds herself at odds with the young master, who has spent much of his life in the Mortal Realm.
c002_interest	I WILL make you\into the Archfiend.
c002_like	Even aides\need to rest.
c002_love	I shall train\you to perfection.
c002_profile	A workaholic succubus who stands ready to fight 24 hours per day. She had once planned to use her earnings to enjoy a leisurely retirement once the Archfiend Contest had ended, but at this point, she's all but given up on it. Just how long is it going to take to make the young master into a halfway decent demon, let alone the Archfiend?Her somewhat uptight personality and overly meticulous nature has started to improve, thanks to the young master's influence. As they say, life doesn't always go according to plan...
c003_interest	I'm gonna go look for Mona!
c003_like	You stupid cockscomb!
c003_love	Hmph! Stupid master!
c003_profile	Her name contains limitless possibilities...or at least, that's what she claims. Simple-minded and gullible, she is easily taken in by just about anyone. She tends to act first and think later, if she bothers to think at all. All she cares about is Mona, so the Archfiend Contest is merely a means to an end for spending more time with her. She sees the young master as a rival for Mona's affection, and refers to him primarily as "stupid cockscomb." Let's just say she still has a lot of growing up to do...
c004_interest	Come play with me, Captain!
c004_like	You just want to\use me...don't you?
c004_love	I'll help you out,\Captain!
c004_profile	A lonely young girl longed for friends, and asked a demon to grant her wish.\Thus was born a Child who treasures nothing more than daily misadventures with her friends: Cheoyong, whose namesake was treated as an outsider, just like Cheoyong's pactmaker.\This reckless girl sees nothing but what lies straight in front of her, and her sole wish is to run like the wind.
c005_interest	The weakest demon?\That's so...weak.
c005_like	I worry about\a weakling like you.
c005_love	I suppose we could be friends...
c005_profile	She took her name from the God of War, Mars, to better convey the belligerent personality that lies beneath her demure appearance.\Until she has achieved her revenge, which she cares about far more than she does making the young master the Archfiend, her battle will never truly end. She is somewhat infatuated with Smirking Momus thanks to the connection their pactmakers share. Mars does not communicate with other Childs well because she is so fixated on plotting her revenge.
c007_interest	I'm not Firo!
c007_like	Firo's going down!
c007_love	Fight me, Firo!
c007_profile	A Child born from the same pactmaker as Fiery Firo. He thinks Firo stole a place that was rightfully his.\Given the name of the legendary bird, he too was reborn from ash (and a soul fragment, but that doesn't tie in as nicely).\His ultimate life goal is to defeat Firo and replace him.\Who knows? Maybe he really is Firo's true rival...
c008_interest	You're just a kid.
c008_like	Are you a powerful demon?
c008_love	I'd love to pit my skills\against yours sometime!
c008_profile	"I can protect myself!"\A Child born from a pactmaker who traveled far and wide seeking revenge on the ex-boyfriend who betrayed her.\Although Frigga is named for the goddess of love and marriage, she doesn't much seem to care about either.\Despite her warrior's demeanor and rough manner of speech, she's deathly afraid of gross things like bugs thanks to her pactmaker's influence.
c009_interest	I never wanna be poor!
c009_like	What do you mean, you have no ambitions?
c009_love	Don't make me regret\siding with you!
c009_profile	Hector takes his name from the great hero of the Iliad, and loves to brag about how he's the best at what he does.\He is aggressive about pursuing Davi, thanks to his pactmaker's unrequited crush on her. He's also selfish, egotistic, and merciless when it comes to getting what he wants.\His unsavory qualities make him pretty much the exact opposite of his pactmaker, who dreams about growing up big and strong.
c010_interest	Hiii, darling ♥
c010_like	Guilt?\I laugh at guilt!
c010_love	Don't you worry, honey.\I'll be your nurse for life ♥
c010_profile	Demeter was named after the two-faced goddess of agriculture and law, thanks in part to the way she resembles her...multifaceted pactmaker.\Though she may seem belligerent and unafraid to speak her mind, it's actually just a sign of how much she blindly trusts the Master.\In reality, she's a very kindhearted Child who wants nothing more than to help others.
c011_interest	I've got this!
c011_like	Just watch, Mr.\Devil. I'll be a big help.
c011_love	Don't you worry about a thing!\Well, maybe a few things...
c011_profile	Deino is named after one of the three Graeae sisters; specifically, the hapless one who always screws things up.\She was born as a result of her pactmaker being saddled with the same nickname, which she in turn got by being one of three nurses who always made major mistakes during medical training.\A natural klutz, she has inherited both her pactmaker's thoughtlessness and her penchant for making mistakes.
c012_interest	Guess I'll call you Captain for now.
c012_like	Just how long do you plan on sitting around?
c012_love	Become the Archfiend of justice!
c012_profile	His pactmaker is a policeman who was once guided by a strong sense of justice, but lost himself to the allure of wealth and power. Born of this forgotten morality, Agamemnon prays for his pactmaker's prestige to be restored, taking his name from the commander of Greek legend.\He's a simple-minded zealot who will do anything for the sake of justice. Though he can't bring himself to tell Danu, he believes their pactmakers would make a great team.
c013_interest	Just what do you\mean by that?
c013_like	Master Ode seems to trust you,\so I will follow suit.
c013_love	It seems like things\will be okay as they are.
c013_profile	Artemis takes her name from a goddess who retaliates ferociously to anyone who provokes her.\She was born from a prodigious young girl, and has thus been an attractive target for many demons looking to form pacts. In the end, the one she settled on was Ode, the quietest demon of all.\After forming a pact with him on the condition that he protect her from would-be demonic interlopers, she has dedicated herself to supporting him.
c014_interest	I will accompany you wherever you go, Master.
c014_like	Please forge your own path, Master, even if you ARE a demon.
c014_love	Under your rule, the Infernal Realm is bound to be a fun place.
c014_profile	A Child born of the desire to uphold justice. She takes her name from the goddess Astraea, who stayed on Earth to the bitter end in order to bring justice to the Mortal Realm.\Though she has the fortitude to never compromise her morals, she's uncharacteristically kind to the weak.
c015_interest	
c015_like	
c015_love	
c015_profile	
c017_interest	I'm going to get strong\so I can protect master!
c017_like	I've got to get stronger\so I can protect master!
c017_love	I've got to get even stronger\so I can protect master!
c017_profile	An aloof dog without a master, Cu Sith once rejected any and all offers for help in favor of life as a stray.\One day, she spotted a shady-looking human going in and out of an alley. Sensing something amiss, she bared her fangs at him.\"That human smells like danger! They must be after master's soul!"
c018_interest	A friend of an old friend.
c018_like	My new friend.
c018_love	I don't have old friends anymore, but that's okay.
c018_profile	Korra is named for an alias of Persephone, the queen of Hades, thanks to her connection to the alternate world known as the Infernal Realm. The young master was actually the second demon her pactmaker had met; the first, who she met as a child, served as the inspiration for the dolls she would go on to make as an adult. For Korra, the distinction between her and her pactmaker is fuzzy at best, and she shifts between thinking of her pactmaker as either a good friend or as, well, herself. Some say that when she is alone, she converses with her demon dolls in the dead of night.
c019_interest	You're just another face in the crowd,\unworthy of my time.
c019_like	You need special guidance?
c019_love	Can you become the Archfiend\if you give it all you've got?
c019_profile	Eris's pactmaker was a teacher fresh out of college who dreamed of teaching bright young students passionate about learning. What she got was a class of troublemakers who sabotaged her performance evaluation by causing a whole heap of problems. It was when she was at her lowest that she happened to meet the young master. Eris, who takes her name from the goddess of strife and discord, was born from her pactmaker's anger. Thanks to her pactmaker's sordid experiences, she has an innate dislike of young Childs and is quick to anger at the slightest offense.
c020_interest	What are you, chicken?
c020_like	The Archfiend Contest\is the gamble of a lifetime!
c020_love	Make sure this turns out\to be a great adventure!
c020_profile	Born from a restless, happy-go-lucky pactmaker with an unquenchable thirst for excitement, Fortuna takes her name from the goddess of luck. Specifically, she is named for the kind of self-destructive luck where you entrust your fate to a roll of the dice. She believes, life is nothing but a series of adventures, spends each day gambling as if it could be her last (though she also refuses to stop until she's won, making her a pain for the other gamblers to deal with). She always rolls her dice to help her make decisions, but nobody else knows what the results of her rolls actually mean.
c022_interest	Wanna try this new game?
c022_like	You have to work again?\Sucks for you.
c022_love	Hurry up and finish\so we can try this new game!
c022_profile	A Child born from a desire to escape from solitude into a world of play. He (yes, he) loses himself in video games like an alcoholic might drown their sorrows in a bottle of booze, leading the young master to name him Mayahuel, after the goddess of nourishment and liquor. As a serious nerd who prefers to stay immersed in his own little world, Mayahuel tends not to get along very well with other Childs, unless he can use his feminine appearance to manipulate people into doing what he wants.
c026_interest	Thank you for freeing me...
c026_like	You're leaving me alone again?\That makes me feel kind of lonely...
c026_love	I want to be tied up!\But only a little bit!
c026_profile	Eos: goddess of the dawn, she of beautiful rose-colored skin, whose tears become morning dew...and now, also the namesake of this Child.\Eos's pactmaker lived her life completely under her parents' control, so she's extremely uneasy about getting to know other people.\The name badge on her shirt supposedly alters its appearance to match her mood...
c027_interest	If you were a woman, I might have fallen for you.
c027_like	Friends forever!
c027_love	Did you think I was a boy?
c027_profile	Cynthia takes her name from an alias of Artemis, famed moon goddess and unparalleled warrior.\Born from an adolescent girl who dreamed of being somebody's hero, this dashing Child has a flair for the dramatic, or at least for embellishment.\Her own favorite hero is the man who models himself after bats, and who served as the inspiration for her own black cape.
c028_interest	Are you here to serve me?
c028_like	What a good servant.\You bring me food.
c028_love	I kind of enjoy\being with you...
c028_profile	A Child named for the woman who reportedly possessed such beauty that even Zeus was captivated by her irresistible charms. Leda was known to look down on others from the highest of high horses, and this trait remains fully intact as a Child. That said, she is also a surprisingly good listener, and will readily help anyone who comes to her for advice (though she grumbles constantly about it). Since her pactmaker was starving at the time she formed the pact, she ended up as something of a glutton, always hungry for more food.
c029_interest	You understand\my pactmaker...
c029_like	You must be brave if you wish\to become the Archfiend.
c029_love	If you were to become the Archfiend,\master, the Infernal Realm would be bathed in light!
c029_profile	Born from her pactmaker's desire to overcome her fear of the dark, this Child takes her name from the moon goddess who shone down her rays to illuminate the night. Selene remains on good terms with her pactmaker, and fervently hopes for her to succeed at overcoming her fear. Elegant, graceful and firm in her convictions, Selene refuses to feel discouraged and stands tall, no matter how dire the circumstances. She does, however, have a watchful eye on the Child who tries to pick a fight with her whenever she goes out at night.
c030_interest	What's the point\of you coming along?
c030_like	I suppose if I were to take you as my assistant, then...
c030_love	If you become the Archfiend...\I'll be YOUR assistant!
c030_profile	Her name: Detective Girl. Her reason for making a pact with a demon: to prove her hypothesis. Since she didn't make a pact to grant one of her wishes, she refused to take a new name. Her catchphrase is "It's just like X" where "X" is a quote from a book she recently read. She has an unwitting tendency to badger everyone she talks to into confessing their crimes, even when they haven't committed any. For whatever reason, she's also intent on nicknaming Cu Sith's pactmaker, Komugi, "the hellhound of the Baskervilles"...
c031_interest	I love you, meow!
c031_like	I want you to know how I feel,\meow.
c031_love	You don't have to reciprocate,\meow!
c031_profile	Mona named this Child after Freyja, the goddess of love, for one simple reason: her pact was made for love.\Since Freyja comes from a cat, she still sometimes mews at the ends of her sentences, and has even been known to call Mona "Meowna."\At times, she wanders off unannounced, but we now know that's only because she's off visiting her pactmeowker. Er, pactmaker.
c032_interest	Master!
c032_like	Master!
c032_love	Sir!
c032_profile	Alecto is named after a goddess who was known for her indomitable work ethic, and speaks in an old-fashioned manner akin to silent movies. She dreams about being the world's greatest maid, but thanks to her penchant for messing everything up, she has a long, long way to go. Nonetheless, she remains undaunted, and true to her namesake, works hard to improve every day without fail. It's a good thing, too, because her cooking, cleaning, and fashion skills still have, let's say...room for improvement.
c033_interest	What a pure demon...\And kind of pitiful...
c033_like	You were kind of\cute just now...
c033_love	I've decided to trust you.
c033_profile	A Child named after the goddess Diana, thanks to her pactmaker possessing a similar temperament.\She may appear calm and docile, but she's actually quite impulsive and narcissistic (and an animal lover, though that doesn't have much to do with her attitude otherwise).\She remains calm and collected in any situation, and has an innate respect for those who are straightforward and pure of heart. Conversely, this also puts her at odds with Mona, who tends to be anything but straightforward.
c034_interest	Well done on\summoning me.
c034_like	I see your worth\for myself.
c034_love	V-Very well, then.\I acknowledge your worthiness!
c034_profile	Named for the goddess of all witches who devoted herself to the study of magic, Mnemosyne prefers other Childs to humans. "Have you come here from another world as well?" Thus does she question them on their origins, though she doesn't bother to listen to their answers; for her, headcanon is canon, and the two are one and the same. Her headcanon for herself is that she was leading a magical army in another world when she was summoned to this world at the moment she seized victory. This is partially a result of Mona's faulty memory manipulation...
c035_interest	Hello.
c035_like	Just watch me broker\these negotiations.
c035_love	You really can't betray me,\can you?
c035_profile	How does one go about seeing a family member who has literally gone to hell? Meet Persephone, named for the goddess who regularly traveled to hell (well, Hades, but who's counting) and back again. The first thing everyone thinks upon meeting her is that she is polite to a fault. She sometimes acts in strange ways, but she does have a good head on her shoulders, and no one thinks ill of her for coming and going across the Infernal and Mortal Realms. Her personal goal right now is to rescue her father from the clutches of hell.
c036_interest	You've got pretty good taste...
c036_like	Hmph!\I couldn't care less!
c036_love	Gimme your clothes.\I'll patch them up for you.
c036_profile	A Child named after Hermes, the god of speed, sports, and most importantly for her purposes, commerce. True to her namesake, she loves to brush up on trends and get ahold of rare curios; less authentic is her shy nature and blunt-to-the-point-of-rude manner of speaking. The giant stuffed bear she carries around is actually a storage container that she uses to keep all sorts of objects that range from strange to stranger. She says that she's just waiting for inflation to send their value sky-high, but don't be fooled: Once something goes in the bear, it never comes back out.
c037_interest	I like you!\You can be my right-hand man!
c037_like	Think you have what it takes to surpass me?
c037_love	Just try and aim\for the Archfiend's seat!
c037_profile	One of the demons taking part in the Archfiend Contest, Judas built up his power in the Mortal Realm's underworld by appealing to people's most base desires.\He named himself after Judas, one of Jesus's disciples who famously betrayed him.\Sensing that the young master has the potential to become the Archfiend, he plans on making him into his own subordinate.
c038_interest	I want you to look only at me!
c038_like	Don't pay any attention to those other Childs.
c038_love	If you become the Archfiend, will that make me the Archqueen?
c038_profile	Calypso was born from her pactmaker's desire to see her former lover, and thus takes her name from the nymph who was Odysseus's lover for seven years.\Because she lost someone precious to her once before, she has come to overcompensate by declaring war on any other Child she deems to be her rival in love.
c039_interest	I'd rather die than\go out with you!
c039_like	Why do you do that to me?
c039_love	It has to be you!\Those are my true feelings!
c039_profile	"I swear to the Morrigan, and to myself, that even if my affections are never returned, I will devote myself wholly and utterly to the one I love." These were the first words this Child spoke on the day she received her name. Born from a pactmaker exhausted from dealing with men, and who dreamed only of living in peaceful solitude, the pact that created her also made her dream come true...by turning her into someone intolerable that no one could ever love. "I don't need guys falling over me. All I need is one who will love me and me alone!".
c040_interest	You need to be punished...
c040_like	You may not be so bad...
c040_love	I can't believe a demon taught me that...
c040_profile	A Child born of a devoted principlist who fully inherited her pactmaker's stark black-and-white discernment, leading her to be named after Shamash, the god of justice.\The concept of "mercy" is foreign to her, and she is ruthless about punishing any who stray from her rigid concept of right and wrong.\She has a very extreme personality resulting from being the personification of her pactmaker's trauma.
c041_interest	You're not very demonic,\are you, short stuff?
c041_like	Do I have to\spell it out for you?
c041_love	Tell me\what you want...
c041_profile	A Child born from the leader of an Underground organization. Named Tiamat, after the goddess of evil, she shares her namesake's penchant for destruction and chaos. This also means she's not the most popular Child amongst the other Childs, since she loves sowing chaos and discord among them, too. For her part, Tiamat has developed a distaste for Thoth, who interferes with her evil deeds every step of the way. Her pet snake, named Nash, is the one creature around whom Tiamat can completely be herself.
c043_interest	Hey! What did you do?!
c043_like	I'm the younger sister?
c043_love	If this relationship\continues like this...
c043_profile	Hera possesses a strong personality that drives her to lead the way for the other Childs. As she did not grow up in the most functional home, she took her name from the goddess of families, so that others would know the warmth of one who truly overflows with boundless affection. She wishes to have a happy family of her own, and dreams of making one with the other Childs. Since she was born, her pactmaker's force-of-nature personality seems to have become even more pronounced, if such a thing is even possible.
c044_interest	Just take it easy.
c044_like	Do you really want\to become the Archfiend?
c044_love	There may be only one way\you end up becoming the Archfiend...
c044_profile	While searching for the perfect name to express his aimless nature, this Child ended up deciding on Pantheon, the collective word for every god...though only because he couldn't think of a name he REALLY wanted. An easygoing pessimist who cares little about pretty much everything, he is amused by the slightest provocation. Thanks to the memories imparted to him from his pactmaker, he also sometimes engages in transcendent acts. A professed outsider, he has an innate dislike for Fortuna. Basically, this Child is about as hard to pin down as a cloud drifting in the sky.
c045_interest	You've never heard of me?\Have you been living under a rock?!
c045_like	If I can charm a rock-dweller like you,\that'll prove I'm a genuine pop star!
c045_love	I'm gonna make you a fan\if it's the last thing I do!
c045_profile	Aria's pactmaker dreamed of becoming a pop star, and believed that if she did her best and worked really hard, her dream would one day come true... The reality, of course, was not that simple. Fighting helplessly to keep her head above the raging current known as "show business," she eventually came to Mona's Counseling Office. One thing led to another, and before she knew it, she was the world's first Child pop star! Aria, of course, takes her name from the term for "solo singing performance" because of her pactmaker's wish to bathe in the spotlight.
c047_interest	Stay out of my way!
c047_like	That's a relief...
c047_love	Stay close to me during\the Archfiend Contest!
c047_profile	This Child, named after the goddess Hestia, longed to embody fire itself, so that all would keep their distance and none would ever take her lightly. She is highly arrogant and has no qualms about showing it, but she will deign to help those who ask her really nicely (PROTIP: a little groveling never hurt anyone). Sometimes, one gets the feeling that her attitude is really just an act... Two of her favorite things are pets (because they always do what she says) and figurines (because they know how to keep their mouths shut).
c048_interest	Revenge on Frej...\A double pact...
c048_like	Why does it always...\You know what, never mind.
c048_love	The Archfiend, huh...\Good luck.
c048_profile	Named after the legendary witch for their eerie resemblance to one another, Neamhain is fundamentally pessimistic and prone to wild mood swings. She is negative to such a degree that she is unable to stop herself from having outbursts, and ends up voicing all of her thoughts as soon as she has them (though on the bright side, not keeping things bottled up seems to work wonders for her stress levels). Her extremely negative energy actually attracted all sorts of demons and Childs to her even before she made a pact with Frej.
c049_interest	You will always\be my sanctuary.
c049_like	What a fool I was\to trust a demon...
c049_love	Can I trust\you again?
c049_profile	Seeking peace of mind, a girl sought succor in devout prayer to God. But at the church where she went to pray, she met a demon instead. Born from a wish to meet the Absolute, this Child chose the name Maat, after the goddess who ruled all of creation. She is happy to spread the gospel whenever and wherever she goes, even though she does not actually know what kind of god she worships. She also has a bad habit of running off to cathedrals whenever she gets a chance, which is admittedly not the kind of place one would expect to see a demon kicking back.

c050_profile	
c051_interest	Hmph... Wannabe.
c051_like	Hurry up\already!
c051_love	What,\can't fight worth a damn without me?
c051_profile	One of the most famous and promising Archfiend candidates in the entire Infernal Realm, Frej takes his name from the nobleman of the gods. He is supremely arrogant, as one would expect of pretty much any demon who isn't the young master, and he couldn't care less if his attitude loses him friends or makes him enemies. After being weakened in a fierce battle against a childhood friend soon after arriving on Earth, he began behaving recklessly in order to recover his strength, which led to Lisa eventually abandoning him.
c052_interest	What a fool.
c052_like	I can't tell if you're really deep,\or just an idiot.
c052_love	Let's give this a shot! Whatever happens, happens!
c052_profile	A Child who intentionally speaks in a manner so light and breezy that it comes across as flirtatious, no matter who he's talking to. He doesn't get along with stubborn Childs, perhaps as a result of his pactmaker's troubled social life. For the most part, he has no qualms with his pactmaker, but he does get ticked off when he thinks about the time he spent suffocating in silence. He tends to look at the bright side of everything (even in cases where there's none) and tries to talk others into doing whatever he wants, so as a rule of thumb, it's best to take everything he says with a grain of salt.
c053_interest	Your mind...\It's empty, isn't it?
c053_like	That succubus is not\to be trifled with...
c053_love	Yes, this is my own mind...
c053_profile	Born from a wish to see inside other people's minds, this Child named herself after Metis, mother of Athena and goddess of wisdom. She speaks entirely in riddles and mysteries, making a conversation with her feel like deciphering a cryptic message from prophet. She sometimes goes out of her way to read minds and reveal her victims' embarrassing secrets. Because it is all too easy for her to tell what others are really thinking, she prefers the company of straightforward, simple-minded Childs.
c054_interest	You are a trusted comrade who saved me from despair!
c054_like	I respect you greatly!
c054_love	It's embarrassing for me to say this, but I'm grateful to you!
c054_profile	A Child who refuses to share her name, claiming that "a true ninja never reveals their identity!"\All that is known about her is that she is set on becoming the ultimate guardian of her master, Heroic Legend. So far, all attempts to convince her of the ridiculousness of such a title have fallen on deaf ears.\Her first master went missing in the aftermath of a climactic battle against Rufus.
c056_interest	I am but a lamb that has lost its way...
c056_like	You're not like Frej,\are you?
c056_love	My prayers\shall guide you.
c056_profile	Believing herself to be a faithful priestess of a god called "the Absolute," this Child is named after the famous French martyr Jeanne d'Arc. Someday, she may realize the fact that she's actually working for a demon now, but that day is not today. In the meantime, this misunderstanding on her part enables her to fight with a holy fervor that would be unthinkable for any other demon familiar.\One last note: the being known as "the Absolute" that Jeanne's pactmaker so fervently believes in? It sounds like no one else has ever actually heard of it...
c057_interest	You're adorable.
c057_like	Sounds like you've got it rough.
c057_love	...Heh.
c057_profile	Known to the local populace as "Blackstar" to signify her presence as the undying light of Harlem Street, Lan Fei's name also means "mist."\The undisputed queen of Darktown, she is ruthless when it comes to excising dead weight, and if necessary, will even use demons as a means to an end.\Be careful not to get swept up in trouble when dealing with her; in many ways, she dances to the beat of her own drum...
c058_interest	I want your life...
c058_like	No need for that.
c058_love	Crush your enemies...
c058_profile	Nirrti the exorcist was in a precarious and tortured state, teetering dangerously on the precipice of death. She managed to hold on to her life, but doing so cost her her memories. It was at this point that she met the young master and formed a pact with him, creating a Child in her image.\Her name is taken from an alias for Kali, the goddess of destruction. Once an exorcist, she is now completely loyal to her demon master. Her one wish is to lay waste to all those who would oppose her.
c060_interest	That's Lady Tisiphone to you.
c060_like	You're not like the others,\are you, baby?

c060_profile	A Child named after the goddess of revenge, Tisiphone, for her pactmaker's desire to get back at all of the miserable men who wormed their way into her life.\Tough, highly charismatic, and an expert fighter, she is known to sneak away to help her pactmaker whenever she's in trouble.\Given her fundamental dislike of male Childs, it seems likely that her pactmaker's memories have left their own traumatic mark upon her.
c061_interest	Let's sing!
c061_like	Is this fate?
c061_love	Once I start singing your praises,\everyone will know who you are!
c061_profile	Siren was born from the desire to have her pactmaker's singing heard by as many people as possible, and was thusly named after the legendary creature with an entrancing voice.\Now that her wish has been granted, she goes wherever the wind takes her, singing about the young master all the while. In fact, even her pactmaker now considers the young master her personal muse.\As it turns out, the concept of Siren singing the praises of a demon was enough to propel her to chart-topping stardom.
c062_interest	Is this romantic love? Or platonic love?
c062_like	Maybe it's a little beyond platonic love?
c062_love	Fascinating.\I could watch you forever.
c062_profile	Europa, who takes her name from a woman so beautiful that even gods were taken with her, was born from an aching need for emotional support.\She can be a handful at times, since she always goes straight for what she wants, but at least she seems happy now that she's letting herself be honest about her desires.
c063_interest	I think you're wonderful. But I'm a little scared...
c063_like	I'm a little scared... But I still want to be with you.
c063_love	I've thought about it, and I really do want to be with you.
c063_profile	Freesia takes her name from a forest sprite whose feelings for the one she loved went unresolved before she could confess them. As it turns out, the one who Freesia harbored feelings for was Hestia's pactmaker, someone she had known since childhood. In fact, Freesia was born from her pactmaker's desire to tell Hestia's pactmaker how she felt about her. Freesia's feelings for Hestia remain stronger than anyone else's, but as of late, she's also begun to show interest in the Archfiend Contest. Since then, her natural shyness has only become even more pronounced.

c064_profile	A Child who borrows the name of the legendary monster Medusa,\who can turn people to stone with a glance.\She believes the world should kneel at her feet,\a leader whose cold demeanor belies her magnanimous side.\Should ruling the Infernal Realm prove impossible, she's committed to taking on the world in her own way.\She's cautious around Mona, who's playing her equally tenacious pactmaker like a fiddle.
c065_interest	You don't think you can seduce me?
c065_like	Too bad. You do have your own charms...
c065_love	Hehe.\That suits you.
c065_profile	A Child who takes her name from the goddess of love poetry, in response to her pactmaker's wish to be loved. Her elegant words convey a strong sense of pride, and she exudes self-love, envy, and covetousness to an unparalleled degree.\Her pride keeps her elegance intact, no matter what the situation.\She has an inherent dislike for her own pactmaker, who can't seem to do anything right.
c066_interest	What a fool...

c066_love	I couldn't ask for someone better-suited\to help me shine.
c066_profile	Aten was born from a pactmaker who is cunning, devious, and two-faced. Unsurprisingly, he ended up exactly the same.\Just like his namesake, who drove away other gods so he could become one himself, he sees others as rungs in a ladder that he can use to climb his way to the top. Naturally, his reasons for helping the young master are entirely self-serving.\Thanks to his pactmaker, he has history with Apollo, but he doesn't particularly care about him.
c067_interest	Who are you?
c067_like	Do you wish for death?
c067_love	I wonder what hell is like...
c067_profile	A Child born from a man who longed for death more than anyone. Given how readily this Child seemed to accept the inevitability of death, he was named Thanatos, after the god of death himself.\Since becoming a Child, his penchant for strange and unsettling behavior—like gently stroking the sickly and eerily staring at people—has only intensified.\His grimdark manner of speech prevents him from getting along with other Childs.

c068_love	I'd love to make\you a box lunch!
c068_profile	Ambrosia: originally the food of the Greek gods, now the name of this Child.\Her pactmaker dreamed of making desserts when she made her pact, so as a Child, that is exactly what she does whenever the opportunity arises.\That part is all well and good, but the problem is that she tries to make EVERY kind of dish into a form of dessert...
c069_interest	Wait, you're the weakest wannabe?\Where did I mess up?
c069_like	What you need is strength training!\Don't worry, I'll tune you up.
c069_love	You'd better become the Archfiend!
c069_profile	Drawn to the allure of sheer power, this Child has no hesitation about jumping into the Archfiend Contest headfirst. Named Ptah, after the god of justice and architects, he was born from a pactmaker who wished for the power to fix what was wrong with the world. But despite this wish, Ptah's pactmaker was blessed with engineering prowess rather than sheer strength, which Ptah ended up inheriting. Once he realized the extent of his abilities, he began working in the Night World's black market.
c072_interest	I shall protect you in your weakness!
c072_like	I shall save you from anxiety!
c072_love	I accept you as my master.
c072_profile	A boy, fed up with his own weakness, wanted nothing more than the power to protect the one he loved. In the end, he resorted to calling upon one whose help he should never have sought, and became the Child of a demon. Yet even now, all he seeks is to protect someone in need.\Vowing to punish the cowardly, Fenrir took his name from the legendary wolf who battled inexhaustibly until his enemies drew breath no longer.
c073_interest	Doesn't becoming Archfiend\seem futile?

c073_love	If you become Archfiend,\will I also find happiness?
c073_profile	She wanted to enjoy living an ordinary life.\However, her younger sister yearned for an ever more grandiose life.\When she saw her sister sell her soul to a demon without hesitation,\just to get attention on a stage,\she had a realization:\she had no dreams or ambitions.\The Child Navi was born from her desire to find a dream of her own.\Yet, both that wish and the Child born in vain were empty.\"I have nothing... I am hollow."

c074_love	I'll never stop cheering for you!\But Mona is still mine!
c074_profile	Believing her role in life to be a cheerleader for the young master on his foray into the Archfiend Contest, this Child named herself Quirinus, after a god of war. Despite her allegiances, she is nonetheless content to cheer for anyone and everyone, which has engendered a lot of goodwill among the other Childs. She looks up to Mona, and isn't shy about pursuing her affections. Conversely, she has a strong dislike of her own pactmaker, who never put her mind to anything. The cat who goes wherever she does is named, quite simply, "Meow."

c082_profile	A young boy was born with a talent for telling fortunes, but at the cost of preternatural bad luck.\His greatest misfortune was encountering a demon and being coerced into making a pact. This Child's name, Calchas, comes from the ancient prophet, but his habit of adding "just my imagination" to his sentences is an idiosyncrasy all his own.\One can only hope that it isn't "just his imagination" when he predicts that the young master will one day be a great king...
c083_interest	I want more, Daddy!
c083_like	Thanks for making me strong,\Daddy.
c083_love	How do you see me,\Daddy?
c083_profile	A Child who loves everything about war, so much that she takes her name from Neith, the goddess of war herself. If anyone crosses her, she opens fire with heavy artillery before a single syllable of surrender can reach her target's lips. To be fair, she opens fire even on those who DON'T cross her. She's...kind of short-tempered like that. The whole thing where she calls the young master "Daddy"? She's just poking fun at him. In her mind, there is no pleasure sweeter than rebelling against the world. Good luck trying to stop her once she goes on one of her rampages.

No matter what she kind of food she makes, it always comes out a literal hot mess.\Oddly enough, once she was born, her pactmaker's cooking greatly improved, even as hers hit rock bottom (and beyond).\Unfortunately for the young master, her one goal in life is to get him to taste her cooking.

c091_profile	She was named for the loyal dog, "Myra," from Greek mythology, reflecting her pactmaker's strong sense of responsibility to another.\Rumor has it that this someone also has a contract with a demon.\This may be because her pactmaker is a bodyguard,\but Myra is often asked to guard weak Childs and residents of the Night World.

c099_profile	"Metal is the ultimate demonic music!" Born from her pactmaker's doom and gloom, Melpomene was named after the goddess of tragedy. Her opinion of the decidedly undemonic young master is less than favorable. Frankly, she seems like she's got more demon in her little finger than the young master does in his whole cockscom...er, body. Ready to make her own heavy metal mosh pit at a moment's notice, she does not at all get along with Childs who prefer comparatively lighthearted music. In particular, she considers Aria, the Child pop star, to be her rival.

For some reason, he likes to speak in exaggerated flourishes, with seemingly random phrases from foreign languages thrown in for good measure.

This was the primary thought that gave birth to Midas, who naturally takes his name from the king who wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas hates thinking about anything serious or boring, and lives only for the present.

For some reason, she cannot seem to remember an important place that was once burned into her memory, and hopes to one day find it again. Though she may be slow on the uptake and decidedly unhurried in general, she also knows who she is and what she wants, which means she refuses to compromise her principles. Pomona thinks of the young master as "that guy who's always hanging around those cool succubi."

c140_profile	Calling herself the guardian of justice, Nodens is named for the god who hunted down followers of wicked deities, and inherits her pactmaker's desire to let no wrong go unpunished.\Though herself born from a demon, she thinks of demons as antithetical to everything she holds dear, and thus keeps a close eye on the young master's every move to make sure he doesn't transgress.\The name of the dragon who follows her around everywhere is Nighty Gaunt.\She knows Ashtoreth from their pactmakers' complicated relationship and bad history, and dislikes her greatly because of her penchant for senseless provocation.

c142_profile	Fearing reality, Hypnos was born from the desire to escape into the world of dreams, which is why she is named after the god of sleep—that, and because she spends way more time asleep than she does awake.\Having gone through most (all?) of her life half-awake at best, she can no longer distinguish dreams from reality.\Both the young master and her pactmaker wish they could live together in her dreams.

Her dream is to become the most reviled villain in the world.\However, to do that, she needs power, which is why she is deigning to work with the young master right now. Unfortunately for her, mere bluster and crazed ferocity probably aren't enough to make her dream come true.\As it turns out, she gets along swimmingly with other Childs harboring wicked ambitions.

c149_profile	"My feelings are only growing stronger, so why can't I express them?" It was this sad sentiment that led to this Child taking the name Rusalka, after the mermaid who was unable to confess her love after losing her voice. Even though this Rusalka still has her voice, she is so shy that she might as well be mute. Forget about confessing her love to the object of her heart's desire—at this rate, she may as well wish for the moon... Still, she remains undaunted, and is now learning how to express her feelings with the young master's help. Who knows? Perhaps her wish will come true someday...

c152_profile	A Child born from a life weighed down by the soulless drudgery known as "part-time jobs." She calls herself Hebe, after the goddess of spring, as her pactmaker's dream is to enjoy the springtime of life (a.k.a. "youth") to the fullest.\A bit of an airhead, what little thinking she DOES do always comes back to one question: "How much fun can I have right now?"\Thanks to the history shared by their pactmakers, she is the only Child who can manipulate Foolhardy Hermod into doing whatever she wants.

c153_profile	Adventuring Epona loves to wander around, heedless of where she will end up. She named herself after the goddess of words because she loves visiting a variety of places and never staying put for long. She made a pact just so she could visit the Infernal Realm, but now that has seen how lazy and cowardly the young master really is, she is not counting on that trip happening any time soon. Her two major goals are to conquer the final unexplored frontier (i.e. the Infernal Realm) and to hand-draw a map of a place not found anywhere in the world.

Unlike his pactmaker, who formed ties with an Underground organization despite being a detective, he is adamant about upholding justice and order. Truly, this is how Thoth was always meant to be.\He always keeps one eye on Night Tiamat, who goes out of her way to mess with him every chance she gets.\The thing he detests most in this world...is the young master's room.

But the real problem isn't her age; it's that she couldn't sing to begin with and has never learned.\Her reputation hits rock bottom, and her agency gives up on her. While drowning her sorrows, her sorrowful voice draws the attention of a demon.\"Wow, she's totally tone deaf!" Her sad story moves the Master, who then recruits her. Now, will she get her break?

c158_profile	A Child born from a young woman who has never succeeded in love.\Responding to her pactmaker's wish to be doted upon, she was named after the water nymph, Naias, who kidnaps handsome men and drags them into the water. Naturally, she loves playboys. Whenever she sees a stud, she makes a beeline right for him.\It is in the height of such passion that she exemplifies her nature as a Naias.

c169_profile	A new life born of the undying soul fragment left behind by Delightful Eos's pactmaker.\She took the name Euros, because it sounds like Eos, the goddess of dawn. She is similar to Eos in some ways, and yet altogether different in others. She wants nothing more than to express her devotion through the gift of homemade chocolate.\She gets on well with Eos, perhaps because they come from the same pactmaker, and she is also close with Flavorful Goga, given the connection between their pactmakers as well.

As such, she's normally all alone. However, she mistakenly believes the reason for this is actually that others are in awe of her power. Her violent nature was slowly but surely escalating\to the point where she meant to break Master,\but then Harmonia, being a cut above her, threw a wrench into her plans.

As a last resort, she sought help from demons as a means of dispelling her grief, but even now, it consumes her entirely. Her name comes from the sea goddess, Thetis, who lost her only son. Her heartache is unfathomably deep.\Instead of opening up to others, she tries to drown everything around her in sorrow.

c209_profile	A Child born of sentiment and delusion.\Her pactmaker is a descendant of a witch and possesses considerable magical powers. For that reason, she chose the name Hecate, after the founder of witchcraft. When others practice magic, she views it as a crime, but when she does it, it's suddenly "romantic."\When drama rears its head, she is easily swept into the role of a frivolous heroine, perhaps because of her pactmaker's intense love of shoujo manga.

m189_profile	A Child born when a young boy borrowed a demon's power to protect precious memories of his grandfather. Shaped like a treasure chest, Surprise Mimic uses sharp fangs to protect its contents. It is generally pretty cheerful, but if anyone tries to steal its treasure, it attacks with wild ferocity. It hates Hot-blooded Boxer because of the bad blood between their pactmakers. Rumor has it that its bite is even more painful than a crocodile's, but no one has ever checked to make sure. Can you blame them?

m190_profile	A Child born of a greedy thief.\It instinctively strives to sate its greed by stealing others' possessions, so it was given the slightly on-the-nose name Boxer to symbolize someone who fills a box. It desires to usurp the throne of the Archfiend so that it can rule over the entire Infernal Realm.\It is after Surprise Mimic's Gold Coins because of the bad blood between their pactmakers.
m191_interest	I found something fun.

m191_love	I'll enjoy myself until the end of the Archfiend Contest.
m191_profile	A Child born of a pact with an amalgamation of souls, including a human whose seething resentment surpasses that of a demon.\Because it bears an assortment of thoughts and desires, it took the name Chimera after the creature that is a hybrid of multiple animals. Lying comes naturally to it, and its definition of "fun" is sowing discord. A natural-born turncoat with an inscrutable facade, it is a Child more demonic than any true demon.

m192_profile	A Fire Dragon born of a town hall employee who dreams of becoming the greatest president in history.\Because it is a Blood Dragon, it turns bright red when it gets angry. Incidentally, it is also extremely short-tempered. Inheriting its pactmaker's wish, it calls itself the Archfiend and desires Lisa, the Infernal Realm's greatest aide.\It seems to have made a deal with the young master in a bid to usurp his throne, but will it actually manage to succeed?

m193_profile	A Child born of the hair from wild cats living in the Infernal Realm. Each little lump has its own personality. Despite them all being totally different, they have one thing in common: they're LOUD. Good thing they're not right outside your bedroom window at four in the morning. They love cats more than anything in the whole world, which makes sense, given that they were born from cats in the first place. Perhaps that's why they come bounding up whenever they see the young master's tail.

After losing his first master in the Archfiend Contest, Mech Commander sought Ptah's help and encountered the young master, and has since re-enlisted to fight in the Archfiend Contest. A certified combat nut, he calls the young master "Master" and is very hard on himself. He treats Mech Soldier, an associate from their pactmaker days, as his own subordinate.

m206_profile	In a dark, cruel world, where even a single loss meant you were cast aside mercilessly, a man was abandoned and became a failure. But in an ironic twist of fate, a demon found him and took him in, giving him a chance to try again.\The man's insatiable greed went on to be reborn as Boss Pig, a brutal murderer that no one could tame. His new goal in life is to take revenge on everyone that abandoned him, and to become the new top dog...er, pig.

m212_profile	Rune's pactmaker loved Cleopatra, but that was nothing more than a fixation born from insanity. Fixation alone is not enough to beat a demon, so he finally submitted to one. As payment for his love, his memories were taken and he became Cleopatra's pet monster, Rune. Now he simply follows after Cleopatra like a hopeless romantic, and his only purpose is to make her happy.

m216_profile	A Child who hates Christmas. The only thing he looks forward to is becoming Satan Santa Claus's Child and laying waste to the most wonderful time of the year. He (rather straightforwardly) took the name Fairy from the fairies of Satan Santa Claus's Christmas. His sole motive in becoming the young master's Child is to defeat Saint Nicole, the reincarnation of Santa Claus himself.\Will Fairy ever achieve his dream of making Christmas into a holiday of demonic debauchery?

m217_profile	A mysterious reindeer who appeared suddenly one day, claiming to be Santa Claus's reindeer, Rudolph. His name, Red Nose, is even derived from Rudolph's nickname.\He is not to be confused with Thieving Rudolph, an entirely different Child who regards Red Nose with suspicion. Strangely enough, Saint Nicole has no interest whatsoever in Red Nose's true identity.\Perhaps because his pactmaker was a reindeer, he stammers a lot, making him hard to understand.

m223_profile	The Yuletide impostor Satan Santa Claus is immediately recognizable from his blue Santa suit. He is a demon who lies in wait to steal children's souls on the holy night of Christmas Eve. The Gift Bag he carries was made from fragments of children's souls that scattered during the pactmaking process. His favorite pastime is looking for good little children and, when invariably disgusted by their innocence, making their lives a living hell. There is rumor going around that Gift Bag's humongous mouth is a portal to the deepest region of the Infernal Realm, but no one has ever checked to make sure.

m225_profile	Once again, I find myself pondering all sorts of things.\About the past, about happiness, about unhappiness...\What should you do if your idea of happiness differs from everyone else's?

m230_profile	I've realized something. Something about the past and the future, about happiness and the ego, about unhappiness and achievement.\My happiness, ego, past, future...all of it comes from me.
