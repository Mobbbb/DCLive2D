c001_17_true1	Master! You need to grow up if you're ever going to accomplish anything!
c001_17_true2	You want to know more about me that badly? Sorry, my height's a secret!
c001_17_true3	You musn't underestimate the Archfiend Contest!\It's tiring to go around fighting battles every day, isn't it?\That's why we should enjoy ourselves like this sometimes!
c001_17_victory	We won!

c001_boss_short	You need to be punished ♥

c001_story2	I'm going to take a little break ♥
c001_story3	No more talking! We have a lot to do today!
c001_true1	Isn't there something you should be doing, master? The Archfiend Contest has already begun. If you're not careful, you'll be eaten alive.
c001_true2	Today's forecast is...downpours!\We'll be making it rain with the blood of the other Archfiend candidates ♥
c001_true3	This Archfiend Contest has been one strange thing after another.\It began out of nowhere, and there's far more contestants than usual.\But don't you worry, master. I'll figure something out ♥
c001_victory	Did you see me, master?
c002_boss_long	You seem surprised.
c002_boss_short	Good of you to come.
c002_ctskill	You're better than I thought.
c002_death_1	I guess...I underestimated you.
c002_death_2	Two seconds...until my last breath...
c002_drive	Let me help.
c002_hit_1	Haaa
c002_hit_2	Ouch!
c002_hit_3	Aaah...

c002_startbt	I'll handle this.
c002_story1	My name is Lisa.\I'm a succubus here to serve my new master.
c002_story2	I've served two masters to date...\and it seems there truly are no perfect demons in this world.
c002_story3	Let us aim for what is best, not what is good enough.
c002_true1	I can tolerate a lot of things, but I refuse to tolerate no time off.
c002_true2	Hmm... Master truly has his work cut out for him in winning the Archfiend Contest.\Oh, hello, master. I didn't see you there.
c002_true3	You have made admirable progress as an Archfiend candidate.\You still have a long way to go, of course, but don't worry.\I'll do everything I can to make you into a capable demon.
c002_victory	Just as I expected.

c003_18_story1	Yours truly, everyone's cheerleader is here!\I'm here to support, so give it your best!
c003_18_story2	Don't think you can\pull the wool over MY eyes!
c003_18_story3	Hey! I'm a bona fide cheerleader!
c003_18_true1	You make no sense.\How do you think a demon like yourself has survived up until now?\It's because I've got your back. Otherwise, you'd be dead by now!
c003_18_true2	Do you really not wanna be the Archfiend, Master?\There's so much you could do as the Archfiend!\You're such a bore.\I don't even feel like cheering you on like this!
c003_18_true3	Since you've got no friends, I'll root for you!\So you'd better not lose.\I'm gonna get so angry if you do!
c003_18_victory	You've got me to thank for!

c004_victory	I'm taking first place!
c005_boss_long	Laugh it up while you can!
c005_boss_short	What's with this kid?
c005_ctskill	Behave yourself!
c005_death_1	Why, you! You're gonna pay for this!
c005_death_2	Daaah!
c005_drive	Everyone move!
c005_hit_1	Why, you...!
c005_hit_2	Aaah!
c005_hit_3	Guh...!
c005_prskill	You look hot. How about I open up some new ventilation holes?
c005_skill	What's with you?
c005_spa	Stay out of my way.
c005_startbt	You might want to take this more seriously if you don't want to get hurt.
c005_story1	Do I have a problem with you? You bet I do!\If you're going to talk to me, you've gotta go through the proper channels!
c005_story2	Even if it takes your entire life, I'll make sure your revenge is served ice-cold.
c005_story3	You're the weakest of all the candidates.
c005_true1	If you're not strong, you lose. But...is it so bad to be weak?
c005_true2	I'll get revenge for you. No bad guys are getting away from me!
c005_true3	You...you don't hate me, do you?
c005_victory	All right!
c007_boss_long	Nobody can beat me!
c007_boss_short	Let your soul burn!
c007_ctskill	I'll serve you something hot!
c007_death_1	Dammit! I'm not outta juice yet...!
c007_death_2	Daaah...
c007_drive	Rage forth, my soul!
c007_hit_1	Agh!
c007_hit_2	Gwah!
c007_hit_3	Ugh...
c007_prskill	Bring it on!
c007_skill	Hi-yah!
c007_spa	My,\uh, shoulders were stiff...
c007_startbt	I'll incinerate you down to your very soul!
c007_story1	Come at me, Firo! I'll stomp you into the ground!\I'll kill you and take the name Firo for myself!
c007_story2	You said you'd make me strong, but you really just formed the pact to protect Firo.
c007_story3	"Try not to embarrass myself"? You'll never beat me!\You're my lifelong rival, Firo! Burn like you mean it!
c007_true1	So you're Firo's master, huh?\Guess that makes you my old man too.
c007_true2	Someone like you would rather have Firo, right? Instead of a piece of trash like me...
c007_true3	What am I supposed to do?!\What's it gonna take for you to notice me?!
c007_victory	Hah! Was that supposed to hurt?!
c008_boss_long	Are you prepared to cross swords with me?
c008_boss_short	Come at me once you're ready!
c008_ctskill	Skinny twerp...
c008_death_1	No! I can't die here!
c008_death_2	Ugh...
c008_drive	Let's hurry up and end this!
c008_hit_1	Ugh...
c008_hit_2	Aaah!
c008_hit_3	You jerk!
c008_prskill	Now!
c008_skill	Move!
c008_spa	It's time to begin your training!
c008_startbt	This should make a good warm-up.
c008_story1	Love is just your hormones messing with you.\After a while, they won't even want to see your face.
c008_story2	How long're you gonna use your Childs as shields?\Defend yourself for once.
c008_story3	Let us test our skills against each other.\I feel like I will learn something once you and I cross swords.
c008_true1	If you can't stand to lose, then work harder!
c008_true2	You can't trust anyone to protect you but yourself...
c008_true3	You ARE technically my master...\It behooves me to see what you're capable of.\I'll take your aide's advice and stick around to find out.
c008_victory	Now this is a battle!
c009_boss_long	I'll have to charge extra for this...
c009_boss_short	How much do you go for?
c009_ctskill	Keep it simple.
c009_death_1	Uh... No refunds...
c009_death_2	Aaah!
c009_drive	This is gonna cost ya!
c009_hit_1	Wah!
c009_hit_2	Gah!
c009_hit_3	Guh!
c009_prskill	I'm a professional!
c009_skill	Why so serious?
c009_spa	Don't think this show's for free.
c009_startbt	You know how much my services cost, right?
c009_story1	If you do work for someone, you need to be compensated.\That's how capitalism works, right?
c009_story2	Yeah, that's exactly what a penniless bum like you would say.
c009_story3	Sometimes I run into people who try to avoid me for no reason. I wonder what their deal is.
c009_true1	The more money, the better. If only my master would figure that out.
c009_true2	Take it easy on me! I've got sensitive skin, you know.
c009_true3	No ambitions? Then here, you can have half of mine. After all, I've got plenty to go around! Hahaha!
c009_victory	Haha! That oughta earn me a raise.
c010_boss_long	Well, well. What a sinister-looking patient.
c010_boss_short	I missed you, honey ♥
c010_ctskill	Ready for an intravenous injection?!
c010_death_1	No more patients today...
c010_death_2	Aaah!
c010_drive	And what seems to be the trouble today ♥
c010_hit_1	That hurts!
c010_hit_2	Aaah!
c010_hit_3	What do you think you're doing?!
c010_prskill	I'll call you when I'm ready.
c010_skill	This might sting a bit.
c010_spa	Aaah, now THIS is what I call relaxation.
c010_startbt	Time for your examination ♥
c010_story1	Ugh, that's it!\I'll just have to make him fall in love with me!
c010_story2	The next time I catch you timidly trying to gauge how I'm feeling,\I'm really gonna be mad!
c010_story3	From the cradle to the grave!\I'll be your devoted nurse for the rest of your life! ♥
c010_true1	I can't tell if you're actually that dense,\or if you're just pretending to be.
c010_true2	There's no cure for idiots who can't read the room!\Are you listening to me, darling?!
c010_true3	Honey, you are one lucky guy. You know that?\There's no other nurse in the world who'd devote herself to a worthless demon like you ♥
c010_victory	Did I help?
c011_boss_long	I'll fight as hard as I can!
c011_boss_short	You won't beat me so easily!
c011_ctskill	I'll do my best!
c011_death_1	That's weird. I did my very best...
c011_death_2	That hurts...
c011_drive	I won't give up!
c011_hit_1	Aaah!
c011_hit_2	Ha!
c011_hit_3	Haaah!
c011_prskill	It's my time to shine!
c011_skill	Go me!
c011_spa	Is the reward for my efforts?
c011_startbt	I'll fight for you my whole life, Mr. Devil!
c011_story1	Oh?! What is it, Mr. Demon?\Is it a fight?! Are we fighting?!
c011_story2	To hear you call my name so passionately...\I'm so blessed! I'll keep working hard for the rest of my life!
c011_story3	It'll be fine this time! I won't make the same mistake again!
c011_true1	Now that I'm your Child, Mr.\Devil, shall I work as hard as I can for you?
c011_true2	I'm always on call for you, Mr.\Devil!
c011_true3	I promise to work hard for you, Mr.\Devil. So please forgive me when—er, if I make any mistakes!
c011_victory	My hard work paid off!
c012_boss_long	Underestimate me and you're in for a world of hurt!
c012_boss_short	Bring it!
c012_ctskill	No way am I going down!
c012_death_1	Was I not...determined enough?
c012_death_2	Captain...
c012_drive	This is it!
c012_hit_1	Wah!
c012_hit_2	Gah!
c012_hit_3	Ngah!
c012_prskill	I'll pulverize you!
c012_skill	Take this!
c012_spa	Hey... Don't stare at me like that. It's...awkward.
c012_startbt	Let's fight together, Captain!
c012_story1	You think you're fit to be a captain?!
c012_story2	You think I'm up to no good too, Captain?
c012_story3	Don't be ridiculous, Captain.\Your decision is my decision.
c012_true1	I'll correct every mistake with my own hands!
c012_true2	Trust me. I'll place my faith in you too and fight to the bitter end!
c012_true3	If you become the Archfiend I want you to be, then I'll fight for you 'til the very end.\I'll wait 'til your mind's made up.
c012_victory	Nice one, Captain.
c013_boss_long	Welcome, distinguished guests.
c013_boss_short	So noisy.
c013_ctskill	As you wish...
c013_death_1	Maybe this was for the best...
c013_death_2	Gah...
c013_drive	Pardon me.
c013_hit_1	How careless.
c013_hit_2	Gah!
c013_hit_3	Stop that!
c013_prskill	Please stand back.
c013_skill	My turn next.
c013_spa	Won't resting too long leave us open to attack...?
c013_startbt	I'll return soon.
c013_story1	Good day to you, sir.
c013_story2	But no matter which road you take,\the most important thing is that you make it through to the end.
c013_story3	I hardly even have time to worry about my migraines while I'm surrounded by this ruckus.\This isn't exactly what I had expected, but it still just might work.
c013_true1	The more things change, the more they stay the same, I see.
c013_true2	All events are determined\only when they have been observed.
c013_true3	Welcome, sir.\I am Artemis. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, and an honor to accompany you on this endless journey.
c013_victory	I have returned.
c014_boss_long	Prepare yourself. I refuse to retreat.
c014_boss_short	In the name of justice, repent.
c014_ctskill	Evil is unnecessary.
c014_death_1	I'll never...forgive you.
c014_death_2	Justice...never dies.
c014_drive	I will show you the cost of your misdeeds.
c014_hit_1	Aaah!
c014_hit_2	Aaah!
c014_hit_3	I refuse to be defeated!
c014_prskill	For great justice!

c014_story2	Do you always gather Childs in such a way?\What outrageous cowardice.
c014_story3	Master, I believe you are fit to become the Archfiend after all.
c014_true1	Though all others may avert their eyes, I will contend with justice to the bitter end.
c014_true2	You yourself are my justice, Master.
c014_true3	Do not worry. I will protect you no matter what you do, Master, for you are my justice.

c022_10_story3	Gaaah, you totally blew it! I should've known better than to put my trust in you!

c024_startbt	The curtain is drawn. Let us begin.
c024_story1	Never seen you before.
c024_story2	That said, you're rather fortunate.
c024_story3	I never meant to stay long.\In any case, thank you for having me.
c024_true1	To be quite honest, I don't yet know what truly makes a king. Thus do I seek to discover it myself.
c024_true2	You ask who will be king? Pah!\What an insipid question.
c024_true3	I'm not interested in us growing closer.\I take it you feel the same?
c024_victory	The only viable outcome.
c026_boss_long	Leave me alone! I'll break you in half!

c026_true2	Why're you staring at me? I couldn't help but notice.\S-Still, the thought of you not being around makes me a little anxious...Mr. Devil.
c026_true3	It's all right if you touch me, Mr. Devil. After all, you're going to protect me, right?\So I'm going to trust you!
c026_victory	I won! Heheheh!

c027_spa	Clash of hot springs!
c027_startbt	Cynthia is here to save the day!
c027_story1	The path to becoming a hero is long and\precarious.

c027_true2	Call on me whenever you're in danger.\I swear I'll be there in a flash!
c027_true3	All I want is\to be your friend.
c027_victory	Hahaha! No need to thank me.
c028_boss_long	You mean to challenge me? Don't blame me if you fall prey to my beauty.
c028_boss_short	You'll become my servant if you lose, right?
c028_ctskill	Move!
c028_death_1	I should have tried sweet-and-sour pork...while I still had the chance...
c028_death_2	Hahaha...so this is it...

c028_startbt	I see my beauty has captivated you!
c028_story1	For a lowly servant to request something of his princess takes courage.\I commend you for that.
c028_story2	...cheapskate.
c028_story3	Don't get so angry. I was just making a joke!\But, thank you. Demon.
c028_true1	That's Princess Leda to you.\And don't forget my three meals per day!
c028_true2	As my servant, it is your duty to serve me.\Rejoice, for I shall also bestow upon you the honor of preparing my meals.
c028_true3	I expect your undivided attention from here on out. And make sure to answer me when I speak to you. Understood?
c028_victory	All thanks to me! Now bow down and offer your gratitude!
c029_boss_long	I am the light that guides wayward souls.
c029_boss_short	Did my light guide you?
c029_ctskill	I shall illuminate the darkness for you.
c029_death_1	It seems my light wasn't strong enough...
c029_death_2	Guh...
c029_drive	Shine forth!
c029_hit_1	Aaah!
c029_hit_2	This is nothing...
c029_hit_3	I won't lose!

c029_story1	As evidence...\Master looks nothing like the demons that most people imagine.
c029_story2	Oh. I wasn't expecting to have my actions prohibited.
c029_story3	You're a person of integrity, aren't you, master? I trust you to exercise good judgment.
c029_true1	If I cannot defeat the darkness, I shall embrace it as if it were a part of me.
c029_true2	Even the darkest path will always\have a glimmer of light to guide the way.
c029_true3	If you are ever lost, master, then look to me.\I shall remain by your side, bright and steadfast as the moon.
c029_victory	Please, use my light to guide your way.
c030_boss_long	I know what happens next! "And then...poof! Everyone was gone!"
c030_boss_short	Halt, or I'll shoot!
c030_ctskill	In the name of my Grandma!
c030_death_1	This was one cold case...
c030_death_2	What could I have overlooked?
c030_drive	Quod erat demonstrandum!
c030_hit_1	I saw that!
c030_hit_2	Gah...
c030_hit_3	Ow!
c030_prskill	I've got the evidence!
c030_skill	Kaboom!
c030_spa	Hmm, this is a tough case to crack.
c030_startbt	Every good detective can hold their own in a fight!
c030_story1	How did a world-class detective like me wind up with a useless assistant like you?\I'm not expecting you to be like Watson, but after studying long enough, even he knew when something was elementary.
c030_story2	Heh, this is quite the paradox. A fascinating conundrum!\What sort of Child do you consider to be "good"?
c030_story3	If you turn out to be on the criminal's side,\I won't hesitate.\Is that okay with you?
c030_true1	Good day, my assistant!\Oh my, that look on your face... Are you being neglected at home or something?
c030_true2	Did you hear how my pactmaker cracked another case?
c030_true3	Hello, my assistant! We work together much better now, don't you think? We're like a modern-day Sherlock and Watson.\Now, come on! It's time to go have some fun!
c030_victory	A true detective never gives up until the case is closed.

c031_startbt	Meow meow ♪ Out for a walk, meow?
c031_story1	Meowster...\I don't like you just because you're a cat...
c031_story2	Master... You're mean!
c031_story3	That's normal, meow. And because I like you, master, I want to curl up and relax around you sometimes.\That's normal too.
c031_true1	Master! What kind of cat are you, meow?
c031_true2	I'm your cat, master!
c031_true3	From the moment we met, I knew I was your cat.\And I always will be!

c032_hit_2	Owww!
c032_hit_3	Eeek!
c032_prskill	How horrid!
c032_skill	There we go!
c032_spa	I used the hot spring water to make this soft-boiled egg for you, master.
c032_startbt	Put your faith in me, and I'll show you!
c032_story1	Ow, my stomach...\Oh, Master!
c032_story2	Coming right up, Master!
c032_story3	At last, my stir-fried custard chocolate cake is done!
c032_true1	Ask anything you wish of me, master! No matter the job, I'll do it perfectly. That's a promise!
c032_true2	*sigh*...\You really are helpless without me, aren't you, master?
c032_true3	You're the perfect master for me!\I'm so glad I'm your Child!
c032_victory	Ouch... My whole body hurts after that workout.
c033_boss_long	Do you wish to rid yourself of impurities too?
c033_boss_short	Allow me to cleanse you.
c033_ctskill	You underestimated me.
c033_death_1	I cannot believe this...
c033_death_2	Ugh.
c033_drive	This is the end.
c033_hit_1	Aaah!
c033_hit_2	Ugh...
c033_hit_3	Eeek!
c033_prskill	Don't let your guard down.
c033_skill	Away with you.
c033_spa	I can feel my heart rejuvenating.
c033_startbt	This is what must be done to protect what is important.
c033_story1	That would be...cats.
c033_story2	They, too, are pure of heart... Like you, master.
c033_story3	You are pure of heart, master. You still possess the soul of a young boy.
c033_true1	You cannot trust anyone. This world is nothing but lies...
c033_true2	I must protect all who are pure of heart. I cannot afford to lose.
c033_true3	You are the only one who never lies to me, master.\I believe in that purity of yours.
c033_victory	That's a little better.
c034_boss_long	I trust you're ready to throw your life away?
c034_boss_short	Lay down your life!
c034_ctskill	Take this!
c034_death_1	This battle...is not yet over!
c034_death_2	Nothing but victory shall suffice!
c034_drive	Time to end this!
c034_hit_1	Ah—
c034_hit_2	How dare you!
c034_hit_3	You'll pay for that!
c034_prskill	Victory is assured.
c034_skill	Ridiculous.
c034_spa	H-Hmph... You really must be a demon, to come traipsing here so shamelessly.
c034_startbt	Victory is ours!
c034_story1	Release me! I'm going back to my own land!\Don't think you can stop me!
c034_story2	You! Return my staff!
c034_story3	And from this point forward, I am asking you...\In this battle as well, lead me to victory.
c034_true1	Accursed demon.\You may have been fortunate enough to summon me, but don't think that makes you my master!
c034_true2	I am the great sorceress, Mnemosyne, and you are but a lowly demon.\How you ever managed to summon me is beyond my reckoning...
c034_true3	If you mean to lead us, demon, then act like a leader.\Our lives are in your hands, after all.
c034_victory	That battle was well-fought.
c035_boss_long	It seems we will not be able to resolve this with words alone.
c035_boss_short	I care little for battle.
c035_ctskill	If you won't listen to reason...
c035_death_1	May this defeat serve as a mark of our friendship...
c035_death_2	Negotiations have failed...
c035_drive	Show some respect!
c035_hit_1	Well, now...
c035_hit_2	Waaah!
c035_hit_3	Eee!
c035_prskill	Very well, then.
c035_skill	Pardon me.
c035_spa	I would like to...negotiate with the owner of this hot spring...
c035_startbt	I wish we could have met as friends...
c035_story1	I suppose it might take ten thousand years...\But they will surely pass in no time.
c035_story2	I bring news of your departed family.\For those of you who will be dying soon, I shall check the local hotels.
c035_story3	Negotiations are rooted in trust,\so talk to me.
c035_true1	I'm sure you'll make lots of friends.
c035_true2	Bridging these two realms won't be easy...
c035_true3	I don't care if it takes ten thousand years. I WILL make this wish come true.
c035_victory	Well done, master.
c036_boss_long	If you want to get past me...you know what comes next, right?
c036_boss_short	Ugh, what a pain.
c036_ctskill	Here goes!
c036_death_1	Maybe my goods will be more valuable once I'm gone...
c036_death_2	Guess I really pulled the short straw this time...
c036_drive	Outta my way!
c036_hit_1	Wha?!
c036_hit_2	Quit it!
c036_hit_3	Help me, Bear-Bear!
c036_prskill	Now THIS is what I call treasure!
c036_skill	Hands off the goods!
c036_spa	So what if he's a stuffed animal? Bear-Bear still loves taking baths.\Right, Bear-Bear?
c036_startbt	Did you find something valuable?
c036_story1	I've never seen that kind of candy before... Is it a limited edition? Please, you've gotta let me buy it from you!
c036_story2	I...I can't believe you... I won't accept this. I won't!\Waaah!
c036_story3	Hehe, you're gonna be so surprised once you see Bear-Bear's insides.
c036_true1	This isn't enough.\I need a lot more goods, and they've gotta have universal appeal.
c036_true2	Isn't my collection coming along great?\I think it is, even if no one else does.
c036_true3	I knew you had a knack for this.\Tell you what: You can see what I'm keeping in Bear-Bear any time.\Just don't freak out when you look inside.
c036_victory	This oughta drive up the price a lot ♪
c037_boss_long	Run home to your mommy, kid.
c037_boss_short	Don't cry, kid.
c037_ctskill	Phew...
c037_death_1	I can't believe I let this happen...
c037_death_2	Guh?!
c037_drive	I can't hear you!
c037_hit_1	Y-You little...
c037_hit_2	Yaaah!
c037_hit_3	You're gonna pay for that.
c037_prskill	Pathetic.
c037_skill	Hahaha!
c037_spa	Come on, kid. This isn't nearly enough to get me fired up.
c037_startbt	Nothing but fools...
c037_story1	The true nature of all humankind can be found in its proclivity for violence.\No matter the deity reigning overhead this never changes.
c037_story2	A tiger won't budge even if a little dog barks at it right?
c037_story3	Even a brat of a demon is still a demon.\As Archfiend candidates, you and I are the same.
c037_true1	You're lucky I took a liking to you, kid.
c037_true2	I don't usually go for cliches, but what the hell.\Turns out you really can't judge a book by its cover.
c037_true3	You'd better surpass my wildest expectations.\If you can't, don't even waste your time trying to become the Archfiend.
c037_victory	You picked the wrong guy to tussle with.
c038_boss_long	Hey!\Don't you dare glance away!
c038_boss_short	Where are you looking?!
c038_ctskill	I can't stand to even look!
c038_death_1	No, not yet...\I haven't gone on a date with Master yet...
c038_death_2	Aaah!
c038_drive	The Master is mine!
c038_hit_1	Owww!
c038_hit_2	Agh!
c038_hit_3	Stop it!
c038_prskill	Look at meee!
c038_skill	Yah!
c038_spa	Oooh? How long have you been staring from over there?
c038_startbt	Huh? You're not inviting me on a date?
c038_story1	Master, Master!\Notice anything different about me?
c038_story2	You're so cold, Master... *sniff*\This is nothing like the romance I always dreamed of. You're so boring.
c038_story3	I was planning to wait and propose more romantically after you became the Archfiend!
c038_true1	How callous can you be?\Here I am, a beautiful, cute, sexy Child who's madly in love with you, and this is how you treat me?!
c038_true2	You're such an infidel!\Yeah? Well if you're not, then explain to me why you're so nice to the other Childs?
c038_true3	*sigh* Talk about playing hard to get.\But that's exactly why I'm going to make him mine.
c038_victory	You're overwhelmingly grateful to me, right?
c039_boss_long	You regret meeting me, don't you?
c039_boss_short	Don't underestimate me!
c039_ctskill	Bring it on, if you want.
c039_death_1	If you don't like me, just say so...
c039_death_2	Guh...
c039_drive	You'll never beat me!
c039_hit_1	That ticks me off!
c039_hit_2	Aaah!
c039_hit_3	That hurts!
c039_prskill	Get ready!
c039_skill	Where do you think you're going?!
c039_spa	I-I'll hit you if you keep staring like that...
c039_startbt	You're not getting away!
c039_story1	You think I'm dull, don't you?\You think that I'm snooty and put myself on a pedestal, don't you?!
c039_story2	You're just a kid! Where do you get off saying things like that?!\Did you really think you could win me over so easily?
c039_story3	Not only am I the most unpopular Child in the world...I even fell for my master. What's wrong with me?
c039_true1	I'll never date you, no matter how much you spend on me!
c039_true2	Be honest: You don't actually like me much either, do you?
c039_true3	It doesn't matter if you like me or not.\I decided I'm going to love you anyway!
c039_victory	Don't count on me helping you again.
c040_boss_long	Are you prepared to pay the price for your crimes?
c040_boss_short	All are equal in the eyes of the law.
c040_ctskill	What a pain.
c040_death_1	I'll punish you next time...
c040_death_2	This must be my own punishment...
c040_drive	Commence execution!
c040_hit_1	Aaah!
c040_hit_2	Aaah!
c040_hit_3	Ngh!
c040_prskill	This won't take long.
c040_skill	Give it up.
c040_spa	Peeping on me in the bath?\You really are evil.
c040_startbt	All shall be punished fairly.
c040_story1	A picture is worth a thousand words.\Take a look at them, and you'll soon see where you went wrong.
c040_story2	As long as there's room for consideration...\I suppose her punishment can wait for another time.
c040_story3	...You're far too soft, Master.
c040_true1	Normally, a Child would never interfere with their master.\But I'll make an exception for you.
c040_true2	You really don't know when to mind your own business, do you?\That kindness is going to get you hurt someday, master.
c040_true3	"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."\I'm still not sure what that means, but I'll go along with what you say, master.
c040_victory	Justice always wins?
c041_boss_long	Go ahead and struggle.
c041_boss_short	This is so exciting.
c041_ctskill	Is that all?
c041_death_1	I can't die here...
c041_death_2	That was...a little much...
c041_drive	This is it!
c041_hit_1	Heh!
c041_hit_2	That hurts!
c041_hit_3	I need more.
c041_prskill	Cry out in pain!
c041_skill	This is stupid!
c041_spa	Muah.
c041_startbt	Welcome to the land of blood and murder!
c041_story1	Did you enjoy my little event, short stuff?
c041_story2	You need more excitement in your life,\short stuff.
c041_story3	I've got some time to spare right now.\Wanna see which of us is stronger again?
c041_true1	And here I got my hopes up, since you're a demon and all.\Some fun you turned out to be, short stuff.
c041_true2	Justice? Peace? None of that actually means anything.\You're just living life in a way that suits you.
c041_true3	There's nothing you want? Don't give me that crap.\Everybody wants something. Besides, aren't you a demon?
c041_victory	Too bad. I was still having fun.
c043_boss_long	What a naughty little demon you are.\You need a time out.
c043_boss_short	In the name of justice!
c043_ctskill	Don't ignore me!
c043_death_1	Daddy... I miss you...
c043_death_2	Aaah...
c043_drive	I'm done playing around!
c043_hit_1	Oops!
c043_hit_2	Ow!
c043_hit_3	Aaah!
c043_prskill	Bad boys get spankings.
c043_skill	Bang!
c043_spa	Oh my god!\This feels sooo good!
c043_startbt	Just leave this to me.
c043_story1	Hmph! How boring. I thought I'd be able to do anything once I grew up...
c043_story2	Grown-ups are nothing but liars...
c043_story3	I think that's what growing up means.
c043_true1	I thought I'd be able to do anything once I grew up...\So why is it I can't? Why?
c043_true2	I want to be a grown-up!\A grown-up who can do anything, all by myself!
c043_true3	You can curl up with me if you're feeling lonely,\my cute little brother...
c043_victory	If you're satisfied with this, you still have a lot of growing up to do.
c044_boss_long	I got bored just waiting around.
c044_boss_short	Welcome.
c044_ctskill	Ah, what a lovely breeze.
c044_death_1	Haha... I guess this, too, is a part of life...
c044_death_2	Hahaha...
c044_drive	Farewell.
c044_hit_1	No way!
c044_hit_2	Gah!
c044_hit_3	Guh!
c044_prskill	I guess I can give it a try.
c044_skill	Heh...
c044_spa	S-So hot... I think my blood pressure's spiking...
c044_startbt	I'm not sure I'm up to the task, but oh well...
c044_story1	Give yourself over to the wind.\Let it guide you as it does the clouds.
c044_story2	The wind is blowing westward.\Then to the west it is.
c044_story3	Now, I think it's time I excused myself.
c044_true1	Living life drifting around like a cloud isn't so bad.
c044_true2	Wishes, eh? Do those actually serve a purpose?
c044_true3	Unlike me, you seem to have a goal in mind.\At least, to some degree. Haha.
c044_victory	I guess we got lucky.
c045_11_boss_long	Today you've got me, Aria, from Planet Party!
c045_11_boss_short	Watch me, Master!
c045_11_ctskill	Be my fan!
c045_11_death_1	I'll leave my mic behind...
c045_11_death_2	Let's meet again on the stage...
c045_11_drive	Let me see you get excited, like really excited!
c045_11_hit_1	Nooo!
c045_11_hit_2	Aaah!

c045_11_spa	This is so refreshing!
c045_11_startbt	Are you ready to have some fuuun?
c045_11_story1	You probably don't even have good taste in music, do you?\I bet you only listen to oldies.
c045_11_story2	This is what you have to do to be the biggest pop star!
c045_11_story3	I'm just doing my best to make you happy, master...
c045_11_true1	You're the reason I was able to get up on that stage.\I wanted you to know that.
c045_11_true2	I've wanted to tell you how I really feel for so long.\And not from a stage, but face to face.
c045_11_true3	Countless troubles and setbacks...\I overcame them because you were there.\I'm gonna sing with all my heart, just for you.
c045_11_victory	Thank you for this wonderful memory!
c045_89_boss_long	Thanks for coming to my show!

c045_89_hit_9	Thank you!
c045_89_prskill	Here I go!
c045_89_skill	Let me hear your voices!
c045_boss_long	You don't seem like you're one of my fans.
c045_boss_short	This is MY stage!
c045_ctskill	Crank up the volume!
c045_death_1	Curtain call already?
c045_death_2	Mic...drop...
c045_drive	This is the final stage!
c045_hit_1	Ow!
c045_hit_2	How could you?!
c045_hit_3	I can't believe this!
c045_prskill	The real show is just about to begin!
c045_skill	My turn to shine!
c045_spa	This is so refreshing!
c045_startbt	Are you ready to go nuts?
c045_story1	You probably don't even have good taste in music, do you?\I bet you only listen to oldies.
c045_story2	This is what you have to do to be the biggest pop star!
c045_story3	I'm just doing my best to make you happy, master...
c045_true1	I've got to polish my act even more, so I can shine all the brighter!
c045_true2	I want to be the brightest shining star in the world!
c045_true3	One of these days, I'm going to make you into a fan!\You'll be screaming my name from your front-row seat before you know it!
c045_victory	That was a great performance!
c047_boss_long	You don't actually think you can beat me, do you?
c047_boss_short	What a loser.
c047_ctskill	You're an eyesore.
c047_death_1	Y-You're way stronger than you look!
c047_death_2	Nooo!
c047_drive	Time to end this.
c047_hit_1	What?
c047_hit_2	Ooof!
c047_hit_3	Aaah!
c047_prskill	Think you can take the heat?
c047_skill	Hmph!
c047_spa	I hate water.\I always end up making it evaporate...
c047_startbt	Which one should I roast first?
c047_story1	What're you looking at, demon?\Would you quit staring at me?
c047_story2	You're way too weak, so I've gotta help you.
c047_story3	What's with that look?\Did you think I was totally heartless or something?
c047_true1	Don't bother pretending to be nice.\I can see right through your little ploy.
c047_true2	If you were to open up to me, then I might be able to open up to you too...
c047_true3	Try to stay close to me.\H-Hey, what's with that look?! Ugh, you really are an eyesore.
c047_victory	Hah, that was nothing.
c048_boss_long	Thus begins the farce that is my life...
c048_boss_short	You hate me too, don't you?
c048_ctskill	Haha, this is going to hurt.
c048_death_1	Now...I can rest...
c048_death_2	I'm gonna get you for this...
c048_drive	Why does everyone hate me?
c048_hit_1	That really does hurt...
c048_hit_2	Ow!
c048_hit_3	Stop that.
c048_prskill	I said stop it!
c048_skill	My turn? Ugh.
c048_spa	You thought this would make me happy? Hah...
c048_startbt	*sigh* I wish you'd all just die already.
c048_story1	When I was trying to think of the most childish and horrible way to exact revenge, I thought of you, wannabe.
c048_story2	What was that?!\Did you just call me ignorant, stupid, and reckless?!
c048_story3	If you were hoping for something more exciting,\then I apologize, but I'm not in the mood.
c048_true1	Unbelievable... How long are you going to pretend to be my friend?
c048_true2	Just go away, all of you. I'm sick of evil and cowardly demons.
c048_true3	You just think I'm a noisy pain the neck, don't you? ...Huh? That's not true? L-Liar...\You demons are all the same. Why don't you just die already? Haha...
c048_victory	No point in praising me now...
c049_boss_long	Let us hold a great feast, as was foretold in the ancient scriptures.
c049_boss_short	You will not find peace here.
c049_ctskill	The light of God will rain down upon thee.
c049_death_1	My lord...thank you for welcoming this poor lamb back to your flock...
c049_death_2	Peace at last...
c049_drive	God has descended from on high!
c049_hit_1	Guh...!
c049_hit_2	Agh!
c049_hit_3	Ooof...
c049_prskill	Rest in peace!
c049_skill	Judgment!
c049_spa	Aaah... This, too, helps me feel at peace...
c049_startbt	I hereby declare holy war in God's name!
c049_story1	Aaah, just the thought of it makes my body grow warm...\Aaah!
c049_story2	My life is as empty as the passing mist. Where should I turn?
c049_story3	After all, the truth only reveals itself to those who seek it.
c049_true1	Peace... It would seem that eternal peace...is not to be found within this bucket.
c049_true2	I cannot hope to attain anything from demons. Where must I go to find peace?
c049_true3	I will not give up hope. I shall place my faith in you, demon.
c049_victory	My lord, were you watching over me in my moment of triumph?
c051_boss_long	Hahaha!\You actually made it this far, wannabe?!
c051_boss_short	You're a stubborn one.
c051_ctskill	Witness the difference in our abilities!
c051_death_1	Haha, I'll be back before you know it.
c051_death_2	I haven't lost! I'm just making a strategic retreat!
c051_drive	Try to keep up.
c051_hit_1	Well, well.
c051_hit_2	Not bad.
c051_hit_3	Ooof!
c051_prskill	Eat this!
c051_skill	Wide open!
c051_spa	Isn't this supposed to be hot?
c051_startbt	Hmph! Pitiful fools! It's time you learned your place!
c051_story1	They were makin' a big fuss over the Archfiend Contest, but then they all go and run away with their tails between their legs.
c051_story2	Man, why are Infernal Realm women such hard-asses?
c051_story3	And once again, she says her piece, then takes off.\Why does she hate me so much?
c051_true1	Damn you, Ode!\I-If it wasn't for you...
c051_true2	If I took this seriously, you wouldn't stand a chance!
c051_true3	I hear you and I have a lot in common!\Now, how should we go about clearing up that little misconception?

c056_story3	I swear to you that I shall find that demon and rid ourselves of him.
c056_true1	I don't know how I became a demon's underling...\But no matter!
c056_true2	Our meeting must also be the will of God...
c056_true3	Very well, accursed demon. I shall fight for you...if you will have me.
c056_victory	Let that be a lesson to you!
c057_87_boss_long	And so the endless night begins...
c057_87_boss_short	How bold of you.
c057_87_bubble_prskill	Welcome to the Night World.
c057_87_bubble_skill	Aren't you a nasty one?
c057_87_ctskill	That's enough. Playtime is over.
c057_87_death_1	I guess this is it...
c057_87_death_2	No...
c057_87_drive	Such pretension is necessary...
c057_87_hit_1	Well, now...
c057_87_hit_2	How careless.
c057_87_hit_3	Ugh...
c057_87_hit_4	Well, now...
c057_87_hit_5	How careless.
c057_87_hit_6	Ugh...
c057_87_hit_7	Well, now...
c057_87_hit_8	How careless.
c057_87_hit_9	Ugh...
c057_87_prskill	Welcome to the Night World.
c057_87_skill	Aren't you a nasty one?

c057_89_boss_short	How bold of you.
c057_89_bubble_prskill	Welcome to the Night World.

c057_drive	Such pretension is necessary...
c057_hit_1	Well, now...
c057_hit_2	How careless.
c057_hit_3	Ugh...
c057_prskill	Welcome to the Night World.
c057_skill	Aren't you a nasty one?
c057_spa	This sort of thing can be nice from time to time...
c057_startbt	Get back to your posts...
c057_story1	Welcome my precious customer...\Oh, I am surprised you came.
c057_story2	Rotten branches will be swiftly pruned...
c057_story3	Never avoid that which is difficult.\Say your arm is broken and your head split open...\only those who endure the hardship will survive.
c057_true1	Leading a group of\businesspeople is no easy task...
c057_true2	Those with ambition are far more attractive than those without.\In that sense, sir, I'm afraid you come up short...
c057_true3	I know why you refuse us. By all means, do what you think is best.\In the meantime, we will remain here, as close to you as possible...
c057_victory	Satisfied?
c058_boss_long	This, too, is within my means.\I shall wipe away all.
c058_boss_short	All is transient.
c058_ctskill	Forgive me.
c058_death_1	At last... Silence...
c058_death_2	Phew...
c058_death_3	Rrk...guh...
c058_death_4	Aaah...
c058_drive	Be free...
c058_hit_1	Destruction is but a new beginning.
c058_hit_2	Aaah!
c058_hit_3	Ugh...
c058_hit_4	Aaagh...
c058_hit_5	Aaah...
c058_hit_6	Ooof...
c058_hit_7	Ngh...
c058_prskill	This is on your head.
c058_skill	Begone.
c058_spa	All becomes duty when neglected...
c058_startbt	Be diligent in all you do.
c058_story1	"Just as small acts of good can fill a great vessel over time,\one cannot ignore small acts of evil and claim to be free of sin."
c058_story2	One cannot use pain\to escape pain.
c058_story3	Now I see. Everything began as a result of my own actions.\I wonder, what can I do to atone for my misdeeds?
c058_true1	To take a life is to irrevocably stain one's hands with blood.\Is that difficult for you to understand?
c058_true2	Arhat...\No, what am I saying?
c058_true3	Even if you were to become my enemy,\that would merely be another duty for me to fulfill.
c058_victory	I have transcended all earthly desires.
c060_boss_long	I've no interest in losers.
c060_boss_short	Get out of here.
c060_ctskill	Time for you to learn a lesson.
c060_death_1	How humiliating...
c060_death_2	You will pay dearly for this.
c060_drive	Just deserts!
c060_hit_1	Hm?!
c060_hit_2	No mischief.
c060_hit_3	You're good.
c060_prskill	Settle down!
c060_skill	Whoa!
c060_spa	Care to join me, baby?
c060_startbt	You think you can take me?
c060_story1	Well done.\Now, don't ever forget to call me\by my full name again, got it?
c060_story2	All I did was teach\a worthless man a little lesson.
c060_story3	That's okay.\Every good woman needs a secret or two.
c060_true1	I'm okay with cute, but not with high-maintenance.\Catch my drift, baby?
c060_true2	What do I like about you? Hmm...\I suppose it's how unmanly you are.
c060_true3	What's my ideal man like?\Heh, good question.
c060_victory	Nice job, baby.
c061_boss_long	Thanks for coming to my show!
c061_boss_short	Time to sing my heart out!
c061_ctskill	Listen up, all of you!
c061_death_1	Guess there won't be an encore...
c061_death_2	I can hear applause...
c061_drive	Time for my solo act!
c061_hit_1	Ow ow ow...
c061_hit_2	Guh...
c061_hit_3	Stop it!
c061_prskill	Encore!
c061_skill	Are you ready to rock?!
c061_spa	This should inspire some great melodies ♪
c061_startbt	Ready to start the show?
c061_story1	Good morning, Mr. Devil! How's it going? You look like the world's about to end or something.
c061_story2	I call it "Pulse-Pounding Saturday, Demon at the Fork"! Put your hands together! After all, I live for the applause, applause, applause!
c061_story3	I just want to thank everyone who supported me and made it so that I could be standing here today.
c061_true1	Good morning, Mr. Devil! How about a little musical pick-me-up to start your day?
c061_true2	I'd love to perform for you some day, Mr. Devil.
c061_true3	Hey, I just got a great song idea! Listen up, Mr. Devil! This one's for you!
c061_victory	Thanks for listening!
c062_boss_long	You're so lucky. The last thing you'll ever see is a beautiful woman ♥
c062_boss_short	No touching ♥
c062_ctskill	Don't look away!
c062_death_1	How dare you treat a lady like this!
c062_death_2	I guess beautiful women really do die young...
c062_drive	Allow me to captivate you ♥
c062_hit_1	Eek!
c062_hit_2	Ugh!
c062_hit_3	Not the face!
c062_prskill	Head over heels?
c062_skill	The more naive you are, the greater the danger, you know?
c062_spa	Haha, are you here to peep on me? I guess I can't blame you, given my beauty ♥
c062_startbt	Just look at all the poor little bees.
c062_story1	You are so dense.
c062_story2	Really?! Yeah, I've been wanting to see it!\Thanks, demon!
c062_story3	You know what, demon? I'm really happy being with you!
c062_true1	I'm the cutest girl in the world, and I don't want you making eyes at anyone else!
c062_true2	Don't compare me to anyone else. Just tell me I'm the cutest thing in the world.
c062_true3	Hey, demon, did you know that you're really attractive yourself?\Maybe my tastes extend beyond pretty boys after all...
c062_victory	What a great date!
c063_boss_long	I-I'm pretty scared...but I'll do my best to fight.
c063_boss_short	I'm scared...
c063_ctskill	Can you hear me?
c063_death_1	*sniff* *sniff* Waaah!
c063_death_2	But...I still haven't given him my letter...
c063_drive	This is for you, demon!
c063_hit_1	Hm?!
c063_hit_2	Th-That hurt...
c063_hit_3	Eee!
c063_prskill	This time for sure...
c063_skill	Look this way.
c063_spa	O-Oh, hi, demon.\I should have brought my diary...
c063_startbt	I can't believe you're calling me up like this...
c063_story1	Um... I was...watching.
c063_story2	Mr. Demon...treated me to...pastries...
c063_story3	For my letter... This time for sure, I'll...
c063_true1	You may be kind of spacey, but I guess you really are a demon, aren't you?\I'm scared...
c063_true2	I wonder what you're looking at, demon?\Whatever it is, I think I'd like to look with you...
c063_true3	Demon...I'll always be watching over you, okay?\S-So, maybe someday...you'll watch over me too?
c063_victory	Haha... I hope this makes you happy...
c064_88_boss_long	Isn't Medusa a great name?
c064_88_boss_short	True winners remain calm.
c064_88_bubble_prskill	One whose very presence stokes fear. That's me.
c064_88_bubble_skill	Naturally!
c064_88_ctskill	Don't let down your guard!
c064_88_death_1	Right...
c064_88_death_2	Thanks.
c064_88_drive	Hear my name and dwell upon it.
c064_88_hit_1	What?!
c064_88_hit_2	Do you mock me?
c064_88_hit_3	Wow.
c064_88_hit_4	Good.
c064_88_hit_5	What was that?
c064_88_hit_6	Hehehe.
c064_88_hit_7	You do what you must.
c064_88_hit_8	I knew you could do it...
c064_88_hit_9	Oh, come on.
c064_88_prskill	One whose very presence stokes fear. That's me.
c064_88_skill	Naturally!
c064_89_boss_long	Isn't Medusa a great name?
c064_89_boss_short	True winners remain calm.
c064_89_bubble_prskill	One whose very presence stokes fear. That's me.
c064_89_bubble_skill	Naturally!
c064_89_ctskill	Don't let down your guard!
c064_89_death_1	Right...
c064_89_death_2	Thanks.
c064_89_drive	Hear my name and dwell upon it.
c064_89_hit_1	What?!
c064_89_hit_2	Do you mock me?
c064_89_hit_3	Wow.
c064_89_hit_4	Good.
c064_89_hit_5	What was that?
c064_89_hit_6	Hehehe.
c064_89_hit_7	It is what it is.
c064_89_hit_8	I knew you could do it...
c064_89_hit_9	Oh, come on.
c064_89_prskill	One whose very presence stokes fear. That's me.
c064_89_skill	Naturally!
c064_boss_long	I'll make this something you never forget.
c064_boss_short	So, thoughts on meeting me?
c064_ctskill	Don't let down your guard!
c064_death_1	Do not hinder me!
c064_death_2	Guh... Ack...
c064_drive	I will show you who I am.
c064_hit_1	Gah!
c064_hit_2	Guh!
c064_hit_3	Impossible!
c064_prskill	Weaklings begone!
c064_skill	You mean to stop me?
c064_spa	A swordsman who doesn't know how to sharpen a sword is a fool who will know only defeat.
c064_startbt	If you're gonna run, do it now.
c064_story1	Someone whose very presence stokes fear.\That's who I aim to be.
c064_story2	You're probably the only demon who's regularly manipulated by his own succubus. Well, I'm different. I won't fall for her wiles.
c064_story3	It simply isn't possible for me to become the Archfiend.\That's why I'm going to take over the world my way.
c064_true1	Charming a snake is easy,\but if the master is weak, he'll be devoured.\Hehe. Best be careful, Demon.
c064_true2	If you want to become Archfiend, you better start praying.\After all, without determination, all you have is luck.
c064_true3	An untarnished victory. Absolute subjugation.\True renown is found in achieving these.
c064_victory	My name is not to be forgotten.
c065_boss_long	You wouldn't fight a lady, would you?
c065_boss_short	Very well, then.
c065_ctskill	Still so young, I see.
c065_death_1	That's not nice at all.
c065_death_2	You really don't know how to treat a lady.
c065_drive	I'm afraid it's time to say goodbye.
c065_hit_1	Aaah!
c065_hit_2	Oooh!
c065_hit_3	How naughty.
c065_prskill	I'll be nice to you.
c065_skill	Teehee.
c065_spa	Aaah...\Care to join me, boy?
c065_startbt	How do you like my unforgettable fragrance?
c065_story1	If you want to attract a man, you need fragrance.\A fragrance so good that they'll never forget it.
c065_story2	Aww, are you upset because I treated you like a little boy?\You still have a lot of growing up to do.
c065_story3	...I can't believe the boy said that to me.\I guess everyone has to grow up sometime...
c065_true1	My fragrance will intoxicate you.
c065_true2	You just might teach me something new about love,\boy.
c065_true3	Teehee, you're so cute. Oh, come now, don't be upset.\If you devote yourself to me, I promise to shower you with love.
c065_victory	Teehee. Congratulations, boy ♥\I think you deserve a reward.
c066_boss_long	I usually avoid direct confrontation...but I suppose I have no choice.
c066_boss_short	I shall be your opponent.
c066_ctskill	Just as I thought.
c066_death_1	You did better than I expected...
c066_death_2	I can't believe I lost...
c066_drive	Checkmate!
c066_hit_1	Well, well.
c066_hit_2	Is that all?
c066_hit_3	I'll have to recalculate...
c066_prskill	How dull.
c066_skill	This isn't exactly my specialty.
c066_spa	Isn't this a little too...vulnerable?
c066_startbt	Dance for me, puppets.
c066_story1	With a tail as long as yours,\you should learn to hide it better.
c066_story2	There is nothing one can do in the face of overwhelming power.\Do as you like. I look forward to seeing what happens.
c066_story3	Sorry, but this is just how I am.\I was better at hiding behind a smile when I was human, though.
c066_true1	Never let your feelings show. At least, not if you want to become strong.
c066_true2	My job is to strategize, not execute.
c066_true3	This will be a difficult contest. I do see a way to reach checkmate... but it all depends on how well you can follow my instructions.
c066_victory	I'm heading back.
c067_boss_long	Allow me help you end your boring life.
c067_boss_short	I'll give you the pleasure of an easy death.
c067_ctskill	Accept your doom.
c067_death_1	The smell of death grows more pungent...
c067_death_2	Now I see... This is what I've been waiting for...
c067_drive	Let's die together.
c067_hit_1	Gah...
c067_hit_2	Guh...
c067_hit_3	Ooof...
c067_prskill	Let us take a break.
c067_skill	Give it up...
c067_spa	I suppose it's nice to forget about death for a moment every once in a while.
c067_startbt	This will be a nice, slow death.
c067_story1	Want to check out the afterlife with me?
c067_story2	Death is my only wish...\The only blessing life deserves...
c067_story3	I embrace your oblivion.
c067_true1	You never know when death will come, so you must not waste time.
c067_true2	Do not fear death. It is a blessing—a peace we are all guaranteed to enjoy.
c067_true3	If you're going to live, then do it without regrets. Death is coming for you regardless.
c067_victory	It seems death has evaded me once again.
c068_boss_long	Make sure to eat your fill!
c068_boss_short	Do you like cake?
c068_ctskill	Dig in!
c068_death_1	Waaah!\I still have so many desserts!
c068_death_2	Waaah!
c068_drive	Feels like you're melting away, right?
c068_hit_1	Eee!
c068_hit_2	Aaah!
c068_hit_3	Oww!
c068_prskill	Dessert's ready!
c068_skill	Sweet and sour!
c068_spa	Once I get out,\I'm making my Ambrosia Special Milkshake!
c068_startbt	Dessert time!
c068_story1	I'm cooking up some treats for you!
c068_story2	Go on and eat up then, would you?\I've been waiting for you to get back!
c068_story3	I hope you like it. This was a first for me.
c068_true1	Just let me know if there's anything you feel like eating!\Whatever it is, I'll gladly make it for you!
c068_true2	N-No way... My cooking tastes bad?\But I tried so hard to make it yummy for you...
c068_true3	You know...\I want to keep making sweets for you, forever and ever...
c068_victory	Who wants victory cake?
c069_boss_long	Now, where to begin?
c069_boss_short	What a pain.
c069_ctskill	This won't do at all!
c069_death_1	Guess I had a screw loose...
c069_death_2	Gaaah!
c069_drive	That's ridiculous!
c069_hit_1	Ooof!
c069_hit_2	Ooof!
c069_hit_3	Ugh!
c069_prskill	I'll fix you right up!
c069_skill	Haha!
c069_spa	Fancy meeting you here.
c069_startbt	Who should I work on first?
c069_story1	Why in the world did my pactmaker form a pact with this guy?
c069_story2	You should try acting like a leader for once.
c069_story3	Power is all you need.\With it, you can change the world...and you're gonna prove it.
c069_true1	Hang in there!\Talentless suckers like you have to power through this sort of thing!
c069_true2	Just do as you're told.\Even if becoming the Archfiend is beyond you, getting close ought to be good enough.
c069_true3	I feel like you'll actually listen to what I want.\Thanks, master.
c069_victory	That's what you get for messing with me.
c072_boss_long	This will be a formidable battle.
c072_boss_short	Just try to defeat me.
c072_ctskill	I must be stronger!
c072_death_1	I'm sorry, young man...
c072_death_2	Gaah...
c072_drive	I'll cut you to pieces.
c072_hit_1	Guh!
c072_hit_2	Gah!
c072_hit_3	Agh!
c072_prskill	Trust me!
c072_skill	Fear not, young man!
c072_spa	I mustn't let my guard down...
c072_startbt	I won't let anyone else suffer.
c072_story1	You seem weak, young man.\Therefore, I shall protect you.
c072_story2	Candy or chocolate: Which one is better?
c072_story3	I...do not want you to get hurt.
c072_true1	Stay behind me, young man.
c072_true2	Are you upset at having to confront your weakness?
c072_true3	I have never once considered you to be a bother.\Don't you ever say such nonsense again.
c072_victory	I'll protect you to the end.
c073_boss_long	Why did you find me?\You'll just get bored dealing with me anyway.
c073_boss_short	Don't expect much from me.
c073_ctskill	Get out of my sight!
c073_death_1	I won't have to fight anymore, right?
c073_death_2	U-Urgh...
c073_drive	Let's get this over with!
c073_hit_1	Ow!
c073_hit_2	Ouch.
c073_hit_3	Eeep!
c073_prskill	Don't do that!
c073_skill	It's futile...
c073_spa	This seems fine.
c073_startbt	Another futile battle begins.
c073_story1	I want you to become Archfiend, whatever it takes.\That way I'll be...\happier than I am now.
c073_story2	...Salome, do you dance every day?\Why do you work so hard?\Why are you so particular about dancing?\Even when you don't ever seem to be satisfied.
c073_story3	Why does she need to find something like that?\Everyone dies eventually anyway.
c073_true1	You want to know what I desire?\I... I've never thought about it.
c073_true2	Living is agony.\If this is the kind of life I have to live,\I wish I hadn't been born at all.\
c073_true3	I...\I do want to be happy...\Will that not happen for me?
c073_victory	I guess I won.
c074_boss_long	I'm not very good at fighting...but okay, I'll be your opponent!
c074_boss_short	Fair and square! Yeah!
c074_ctskill	I'll do my best!
c074_death_1	It's not over...'til it's over...!
c074_death_2	I guess...I didn't cheer loud enough...
c074_drive	How can you already be tired?!
c074_hit_1	Hey!
c074_hit_2	Aaah!
c074_hit_3	Eeek!
c074_prskill	Gotta be stronger!
c074_skill	Eeyah!
c074_spa	Liar!\You said this would feel good, but it's just a bunch of hot water!
c074_startbt	Let's have a great battle today!
c074_story1	Morning, noon, night... I'm gonna cheer for you twenty-four hours a day! I can't wait!
c074_story2	Come on, Mr. Demon, wake up! It's morning!\Hurry! Covers off, slippers on! You can do it!
c074_story3	Will you make me your girlfriend, Ms. Mona?!\I promise I'll devote myself to you forever!\Eek, I can't believe I actually said it!
c074_true1	Listen, just because you mean well doesn't mean things will always turn out well.\...Wait, what? That doesn't sound like me!
c074_true2	Don't worry, Mr. Devil! You'll be okay!\It'll be your turn to shine someday!
c074_true3	Did my cheering help you out, Mr. Devil? I hope it did.\I want both you and Ms. Mona to be happy!
c074_victory	I hope I was helpful, Mr. Devil.
c082_boss_long	I didn't think I'd see you here.
c082_boss_short	Looks like my intuition is still on the mark.
c082_ctskill	My luck has turned!
c082_death_1	It really was just my imagination...
c082_death_2	Just as I thought... My worst luck ever...
c082_drive	Get out of my sight!
c082_hit_1	Aaah!
c082_hit_2	No biggie...
c082_hit_3	I'm used to pain.
c082_prskill	I don't know if my intuition here is on the money, but what the hell!
c082_skill	Let's do this!
c082_spa	C-Can't say I was expecting this. I thought bathing was something you did alone...
c082_startbt	I had a feeling about this. Could just be my imagination, though.
c082_story1	Call on me if you need my help. I'll be there whenever you need me.
c082_story2	I'm still not quite sure what to make of that strange relationship...
c082_story3	I like living here more than you think, master.
c082_true1	Maybe I'm fated to always have bad luck.
c082_true2	If I keep going where life takes me, then maybe someday...
c082_true3	I don't know how much use my ability can be.\I'll do my best, of course... You're not disappointed, are you?\Is it just my imagination?
c082_victory	Guess I actually got lucky for a change...
c083_boss_long	What're you waiting for? Let's get started already!
c083_boss_short	Took you long enough!
c083_ctskill	Bang!
c083_death_1	Ugh... Dammit!
c083_death_2	Sorry I'm such a good-for-nothing, Daddy...
c083_drive	You wanna see fireworks?!
c083_hit_1	Hmph!
c083_hit_2	That didn't hurt one bit.
c083_hit_3	Hahaha!
c083_prskill	Let's do this thing!
c083_skill	Try this on for size.
c083_spa	What's on your mind, Daddy? Your face is all red.
c083_startbt	Bring it on!
c083_story1	Huh. You really sound like a Daddy when you say stuff like that.
c083_story2	...Okay, Daddy. I'll be a good girl and do what you want this time.
c083_story3	So I've gotta protect him.
c083_true1	What do I desire? How the hell should I know? I just do what I want, when I want!
c083_true2	Lend me your strength, and I promise I'll win!
c083_true3	Don't worry, Daddy. I promise I'll take good care of ya!\Gotta pay you back for raising me, after all! Hahaha!
c083_victory	It ain't worth fighting unless you win.
c086_boss_long	Oh boy, fresh ingredients!
c086_boss_short	Eat up!
c086_ctskill	Do you like spicy food?
c086_death_1	I must not have put enough heart into it...
c086_death_2	Mr. Devil...
c086_drive	Here's the main dish!
c086_hit_1	Aaah!
c086_hit_2	A-Are you angry at me?
c086_hit_3	That's mean...
c086_prskill	I'm going to put my heart into it!
c086_skill	This one's sweet and sour!
c086_spa	Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub! *chomp*
c086_startbt	It's cooking time!
c086_story1	Go on, have some!\It's made with lots of love!
c086_story2	Mr. Devil, Mr. Devil! I tried my hand at a new dish!
c086_story3	Mr. Devil, love of my life!\I made you a full-course meal, with lots of love!
c086_true1	Sunken eyes...rough skin...stunted growth...\You obviously haven't been eating well, Mr. Devil!
c086_true2	Just watching you eat with pleasure is enough to fill me up, Mr.\Devil!
c086_true3	I'm going to cook you a meal you'll never forget!\The secret ingredient will be lots and lots of love!
c086_victory	What would you like for dessert?
c090_boss_long	How dare you dirty my room...
c090_boss_short	Know your place.
c090_ctskill	Fool.
c090_death_1	You'll pay for this...
c090_death_2	I'll never give up... Never!
c090_drive	I'll make you wish you were never born.
c090_hit_1	Gah!
c090_hit_2	Why, you...
c090_hit_3	I'll show you!
c090_prskill	Bow down before me!
c090_skill	Hrgh!
c090_spa	Well? Come on in already.
c090_startbt	I'll straighten you out soon enough.
c090_story1	Don't be so brazen!\First you come as a commoner and then call yourself master? That's a bit presumptuous.
c090_story2	Of course...let's fight!\I am sure not to lose.\That would be fitting for my pactmaker.
c090_story3	Though I do get a strange feeling, her meddling, while annoying, seems unavoidable.
c090_true1	You really are useless, aren't you?!
c090_true2	How do you expect to become the Archfiend like that?\You're nowhere near ready for what that entails!
c090_true3	Don't disappoint me,\demon.
c090_victory	Commence with the song of triumph!
c091_boss_long	I'll hold the fort, even if it costs me my life.
c091_boss_short	I'll protect the fort.
c091_ctskill	Watch out!
c091_death_1	Th-This is just a strategic retreat...
c091_death_2	Ugh...
c091_drive	Let me put an end to this.
c091_hit_1	Oompf!
c091_hit_2	Urgh!
c091_hit_3	Not a chance!
c091_prskill	Shall I annihilate them?
c091_skill	Ah-hah!
c091_spa	Aaah... I haven't felt so relaxed in a long time.
c091_startbt	Commence the operation.
c091_story1	Whenever I see the master, I can't help worrying about him.
c091_story2	Training is my duty as a soldier.\I must be ready for battle at all times.
c091_story3	I don't think Sir Vulcan likes me.
c091_true1	I don't know if I'm being helpful to you, Master.
c091_true2	I'm willing to fight for you at anytime, Master.\But you must be able to protect yourself.
c091_true3	My value lies in my ability to protect you.\I fight for you, as well as myself.
c091_victory	Congratulations, Master.
c095_boss_long	Losing is not an option!
c095_boss_short	I WILL beat you!
c095_ctskill	Is that all you've got?
c095_death_1	If only...I'd been stronger...
c095_death_2	Am I still not strong enough?
c095_drive	One punch is all it'll take!
c095_hit_1	Ugh...
c095_hit_2	Gah!
c095_hit_3	Damn!
c095_prskill	This is so exciting, right?
c095_skill	Here I go!
c095_spa	Aaah, I can almost feel my body melting away...
c095_startbt	You'll soon see what I can do!
c095_story1	But... I can't let me people just bully Master!
c095_story2	Be confident!
c095_story3	Thank you, Master!\Fight me with everything you got!
c095_true1	It's pointless if you don't win.
c095_true2	If I can beat you, master...that'll make me the strongest, right?
c095_true3	Together, master, there's nobody we can't beat!\Don't worry, I'll go in first and soften 'em up for you!
c095_victory	All right, who's next?!
c099_boss_long	Get ready for some heavy metal!
c099_boss_short	Come on! Yeaaah!
c099_ctskill	Now screeeam!
c099_death_1	Metal...will never die...
c099_death_2	Death to...posers...
c099_drive	Let's shred this thing!
c099_hit_1	Haaa
c099_hit_2	Damn!
c099_hit_3	Guh!
c099_prskill	Tremolo!
c099_skill	Yeaaah!
c099_spa	Lounging around a hot spring? This isn't metal at all!
c099_startbt	Are you ready to rock?!
c099_story1	This room of yours need more metal, and I'm gonna bring it!
c099_story2	I like ya, Demon.\So I wrote this badass rock song just for you!
c099_story3	Get angry! Let it all out! That's what metal is all about!
c099_true1	Wake up, you pathetic excuse for a demon!\You're not nearly metal enough!
c099_true2	Come on, demon! Be my muse! Inspire me!\...Oh, forget it. You couldn't inspire a bug to buzz off.
c099_true3	I'll put on a metal concert for you more demonic than any demon ever!\In exchange, you hurry up and become the Archfiend! Got it?!
c099_victory	Come on! Rock 'n' roll, baby!
c101_boss_long	May the world be filled with bright smiles...
c101_boss_short	Please smile.
c101_ctskill	I just want everyone to be happy...
c101_death_1	*sob* How could you...
c101_death_2	Is there no hope?
c101_drive	This is what you get for hurting others.
c101_hit_1	Ow!
c101_hit_2	Please stop.
c101_hit_3	Be nice!
c101_prskill	Think about what you did!
c101_skill	For a kinder world!
c101_spa	Yeeeow, hot!
c101_startbt	Just because I'm kind doesn't mean I'm weak.
c101_story1	You're not kind at all. You really are a demon...
c101_story2	...I know now that you're actually very kind.
c101_story3	Now that I know, I'm honored I can help you.
c101_true1	I want to be kind and warmhearted.
c101_true2	Please love me. I promise I'll be good...
c101_true3	I'm going to put my trust in you, so...please don't disappoint me. Promise me, okay?
c101_victory	Now everyone can relax and smile in peace.
c106_boss_long	Betrayal is unforgivable!
c106_boss_short	Traitor!
c106_ctskill	Are you underestimating me?
c106_death_1	How dare you!
c106_death_2	I'll get you for this...
c106_drive	Prepare to die!
c106_hit_1	Aaah!
c106_hit_2	That hurts!
c106_hit_3	Watson!
c106_prskill	The price for betrayal is death.
c106_skill	Hmph!
c106_spa	What a wonderful place you've taken me to...\Maybe I can trust you a bit after all.
c106_startbt	At last, I can take my revenge.
c106_story1	Can you hear the wind, Watson?\It's as if the sky itself is blessing our love!
c106_story2	Why couldn't you be rich?
c106_story3	Oh, Demon! Mr. Demon!\You'll buy me a new doll, right? Right?!
c106_true1	This is Watson, my friend.\You probably wouldn't know it from looking at her, but she's actually a very kind and beautiful young witch.
c106_true2	If you refuse to do what I say, I'll follow you to the ends of the earth...\No, the ends of the Infernal Realm, and take my revenge!
c106_true3	I was just thinking I could use a new doll...\And you look like you'll do nicely!
c106_victory	Great job, Watson. ...Oh, and you too, I guess.
c107_boss_long	'tis true, I am guilty!
c107_boss_short	Bravissimo!
c107_ctskill	Now, it is your turn to be moved!
c107_death_1	Talk about a cold treatment...\I love it!
c107_death_2	Fantastico!
c107_drive	Farewell, mi amore!
c107_hit_1	Oooh la la!
c107_hit_2	Aaah!
c107_hit_3	Hah-hah-hah!
c107_prskill	Impact! Excitement! Inspiration!
c107_skill	Tres bien!
c107_spa	Tres bien! This is truly paradise...
c107_startbt	A new life, a new light...\An all-new venue!
c107_story1	I would like a little more inspiration.
c107_story2	Oui, monsieur! I will now attempt photosynthesis!
c107_story3	Aaah, what a beautiful world!
c107_true1	Behold the beauty of these\gorgeous flower petals!
c107_true2	I beseech you, inspire me!\Be as a phantom thief and steal my very heart away!
c107_true3	At last, the door to a new world is open!\Honored godfather! I swear to you now that I shall spend my life repaying you for awakening me!
c107_victory	Sunflower\power!
c110_boss_long	I think we both know who's gonna win this.
c110_boss_short	I've so got this.
c110_ctskill	You haven't seen anything yet!
c110_death_1	You got lucky...
c110_death_2	Zivaaa!
c110_drive	One hit's all it'll take!
c110_hit_1	Why, you!
c110_hit_2	Ugh!
c110_hit_3	Not half bad!
c110_prskill	Make sure you grit your teeth!
c110_skill	Can you handle this?
c110_spa	What are you looking at?\Don't do anything weird. Get outta here!
c110_startbt	Ready to go!
c110_story1	I'M the only one who can do that!\Isn't that right, my queen?
c110_story2	Yes, she absolutely does!\To me, Ziva is queen, and Archfiend,\and God Herself...\Anyway, she's the most important thing in the world!
c110_story3	And she's so careless. Always messing up in the weirdest ways...\That woman can't do anything without me.
c110_true1	You cheeky brat!\Who do you think you're ordering around?\Huh?\You wanna go a round with me, is that it?
c110_true2	ARGHHH!\I can't sit still. I wanna fight so much!\But if Ziva doesn't want me to,\I just have to restrain myself!
c110_true3	The plan to make Ziva the Archfiend went up in smoke.\So, once the contest is over,\maybe we'll go on a trip to somewhere warm!
c110_victory	You weren't much of a match for me.
c112_boss_long	I'll tell you where you should go.
c112_boss_short	Do you know the truth?
c112_ctskill	I'll be fooled no longer!
c112_death_1	Not again...
c112_death_2	D-Did I choose wrong?
c112_drive	Go back to where you belong!
c112_hit_1	Ah—
c112_hit_2	Damn!
c112_hit_3	Not bad!
c112_prskill	Care to see who's right?
c112_skill	How dull.
c112_spa	If you think I've opened up to you just because you brought me\somewhere so...delightful...you're gravely...mistaken...
c112_startbt	Subdue the chaos.
c112_story1	Ridiculous. Me, on a team of demons?
c112_story2	"I'm just me," eh...\Perhaps the best thing for me to do is follow suit and live my own life in a way that suits me.
c112_story3	...Very well, I'll place my trust in you.\S-So, uh...g-good to be here.
c112_true1	If you thought a little flattery would win me over, you're gravely mistaken.\I will never trust a demon.
c112_true2	A demon can never be more than a demon.\No matter how kind you may appear to be, I know that deep down, your very essence is rooted in chaos and destruction.
c112_true3	Why did my pactmaker seek help from a demon?\I suppose might really does make right.
c112_victory	I see the light. It's faint, but it's there...
c115_boss_long	This looks like it'll be a tremendously boring performance... You okay with that?
c115_boss_short	Do you like boring performances?
c115_ctskill	This is my misery.
c115_death_1	Misery really does suit me...
c115_death_2	Aaah.
c115_drive	Martelé!
c115_hit_1	Aaah...
c115_hit_2	Ooof!
c115_hit_3	Aaah...
c115_prskill	Vibrato!
c115_skill	Prepare to weep.
c115_spa	Even time spent at a hot spring is meaningless...
c115_startbt	Join me in misery.
c115_story1	As if dying wasn't enough, the first person I met had to be a demon...
c115_story2	I am dead ♬\Even though I'm still young ♬
c115_story3	Stupid master. Don't worry, I'll keep making you sad for a long time to come ♪
c115_true1	This world is awash in misery...\Hope is a false ideal that holds no merit...
c115_true2	Demon... There is no way you can hope to alleviate my suffering...
c115_true3	Even suffering can be a comfort at times.\You'll know what I mean soon enough.
c115_victory	I shall play you a requiem...
c117_boss_long	I wonder: Which of us hides the greater darkness within?
c117_boss_short	May the blackest heart triumph.
c117_ctskill	Can you feel the darkness?
c117_death_1	Thank goodness my broom is okay...
c117_death_2	Aaah!
c117_drive	Burn in the fires of eternity!
c117_hit_1	Ooof!
c117_hit_2	Eeek!
c117_hit_3	My broom...
c117_prskill	A curse upon your head!
c117_skill	Don't bother resisting.
c117_spa	I wonder if there's a spell to permanently stop my glasses from fogging up...
c117_startbt	Can you hear the howling of the Infernal Realm?!
c117_story1	Don't touch my broom!
c117_story2	How could you hate the Devil so much but willingly borrow his power?
c117_story3	A-Am I...like a demon myself?
c117_true1	I don't care if you're a demon. Not as long as I can make use of your power, at least.
c117_true2	If you really are a demon, why don't you act more in your own self-interest?
c117_true3	I've never even heard of a demon like you before.\I just can't wrap my head around it. I wonder how you'll surprise me today.
c117_victory	Demonic power truly is alluring.
c120_boss_long	I don't like fighting...but I guess I don't have a choice.
c120_boss_short	Let's play.
c120_ctskill	Sorry about this!
c120_death_1	I don't wanna fight anymore! Waaah!
c120_death_2	Ooogh...
c120_drive	Be happy!
c120_hit_1	Eek!
c120_hit_2	Aaah!
c120_hit_3	Aaah!
c120_prskill	Will you listen to my song?
c120_skill	Go easy on me...
c120_spa	I'm so happy...
c120_startbt	I don't like fighting...
c120_story1	I'll make a flower crown for you.
c120_story2	Mister, why are you so mad?\I don't like it when people fight.
c120_story3	Hehe, everyone's so happy.
c120_true1	I'll make some flowers bloom, okay?\That way, you won't feel so lonely.
c120_true2	Please don't be sad.\Look, I'll make some pretty flowers bloom for you.
c120_true3	Hey, look at all the pretty flowers!\I wonder what kind will bloom next?
c120_victory	Now we can all get along.
c121_boss_long	Have you ever heard a song screamed out from the depths of one's soul?
c121_boss_short	Have you ever heard a song sung straight from the soul?
c121_ctskill	Be quiet!
c121_death_1	Guess I didn't have enough power to rock you to your core...
c121_death_2	Listen to my song...
c121_drive	Louder!
c121_hit_1	Gah...
c121_hit_2	This is nothing.
c121_hit_3	So this is who you are, huh?
c121_prskill	Try and sing!
c121_skill	Listen up.
c121_spa	C-Could you not stare too much?
c121_startbt	Allow me to suppress the darkness within you.
c121_story1	A place where demons can rest, eh?\Do demons need that sort of thing too?
c121_story2	You're partly to blame for what happened to my pactmaker.
c121_story3	Well, no one understands the whole truth of life all at once.\The same is true of music.
c121_true1	I guess I had the wrong idea about you.\Turns out you're just a slacker who only thinks about sleeping.
c121_true2	I feel like if I talk to you,\I'll be inspired to write a great new song.
c121_true3	Sing with me.\I've never heard a demon sing before, after all.
c121_victory	Quiet at last.
c122_10_boss_long	You're not getting in without an invite.
c122_10_boss_short	Can you go home? You're not invited.
c122_10_ctskill	Clear the way.
c122_10_death_1	I'm gonna take a little break...
c122_10_death_2	Aah, I'm so tired...
c122_10_drive	You can't go past this point.
c122_10_hit_1	*sigh*
c122_10_hit_2	How annoying...
c122_10_hit_3	Where are your manners?
c122_10_prskill	How about another drink?
c122_10_skill	This one's on the house.
c122_10_spa	This is the life.\If I could collect places, this one would've long been\in my hoard.
c122_10_startbt	This way, please.
c122_10_story1	As if it weren't insulting enough being made to wear this,\it couldn't be more shameless.
c122_10_story2	W-Welcome...\Th-Thank you so much...\for coming to Tiwaz and Juno's wedding.
c122_10_story3	When you can seize an opportunity,\milk it for all it's worth.\Don't leave any room for regrets later.
c122_10_true1	That damn Juno...\How dare he humiliate me like this?\I will never forget this insult...
c122_10_true2	The guests just keep coming.\I have to watch to make sure no one's gunning for my treasure.
c122_10_true3	I was so irritated\I almost wasted precious time.\I'm gonna have all the fun I can have\so long as I'm lending out my island.
c122_10_victory	Now, we're even.
c122_boss_long	Are you a customer? Or an intruder?
c122_boss_short	Maybe I'll let you have a taste of my power.
c122_ctskill	Watch out for this one.
c122_death_1	No... My treasure...
c122_death_2	I can't be defeated...
c122_drive	I couldn't tolerate being thought little of!
c122_hit_1	Oof!
c122_hit_2	This can't be...
c122_hit_3	Ouch!
c122_prskill	This is mine.
c122_skill	No touchie.
c122_spa	This is the life.\If I could collect places, this one would have long been\in my hoard.
c122_startbt	An uninvited guest?
c122_story1	Relax. You won't get hurt\so long as you keep your fingers away from my hoard.
c122_story2	Don't think you can take my treasure for free!
c122_story3	*sigh*\When I'm surrounded by sparkles...\That's when my soul shines.
c122_true1	I never intended to rely on anyone.\I'll need to thank you somehow.
c122_true2	In this world, you give and take.\It makes no sense for one party to be at a loss, right?
c122_true3	So long as I have treasure, I don't need anything else.
c122_victory	You've paid the price. In full.
c123_boss_long	I can't wait to see how well this turns out.
c123_boss_short	I wonder what you've got.
c123_ctskill	Do it again!
c123_death_1	Guess my idea was rejected...
c123_death_2	Aaagh!
c123_drive	This is stupid!
c123_hit_1	Eek!
c123_hit_2	Ooof!
c123_hit_3	Eeek!
c123_prskill	This is what it takes!
c123_skill	This won't do at all!
c123_spa	Meeeow. I'm in happy cat mode, meow.
c123_startbt	Try and move me.
c123_story1	I don't like aaanything.\From that building over there to this building over here.
c123_story2	You'd better be grateful.\I'm gonna help you rake in the dough hand over fist!
c123_story3	Ugh... Yeah. I just haven't tried hard enough.\If I think of an even more groundbreaking plan,\then he's gotta admit I'm right!
c123_true1	I need you to think outside the box!\How is it that you demons are even more old-fashioned than humans?
c123_true2	Another miss? That's okay.\I'll see for myself just how long you can ignore me.
c123_true3	Would it kill you to say something nice for a change? Is it so hard to say "Good job" or something?\Well, I'm not gonna praise you for anything anymore either!
c123_victory	Where's the innovation?
c124_boss_long	Well, well. So you've made it this far.
c124_boss_short	Welcome. Took you long enough.
c124_ctskill	Sorry, I'm not messing around.
c124_death_1	I-I failed?
c124_death_2	How could I let this happen?
c124_drive	I shall risk my life for you...
c124_hit_1	Aaah!
c124_hit_2	I haven't felt pain in some time...
c124_hit_3	Aaah!
c124_prskill	I'll make sure you never forget this.
c124_skill	Don't touch me...
c124_spa	It feels like my body is burning up...\I don't really care for heat...
c124_startbt	Let's just take it nice and easy.
c124_story1	If there's something on your mind, say it.
c124_story2	Me? You're depending on me?\You're more foolish than you look.
c124_story3	And as long as I finish off every last one of you,\who's going to be around to complain, hm?
c124_true1	I don't get why you ignore your demonic impulses...\You baffle me sometimes.
c124_true2	This place is nothing but a headache.\But I suppose the nights are lovely...
c124_true3	You could stand to make better use of other people.\Doubt, suspicion, guarding yourself against betrayal...\I don't know what it is you believe in, but if you don't watch yourself, you're going to end up hurt.
c124_victory	Thanks.
c125_10_boss_long	Attis... Protect me...
c125_10_boss_short	Rusalka...\Leave this to me!

c125_10_skill	Rusalka...
c125_10_spa	The weather today is positively perfect\for a dip in the hot springs.
c125_10_startbt	I was waiting for you, Rusalka.
c125_10_story1	Do your very best.\Love is earned only by those who have courage.
c125_10_story2	Worrying is nothing more than a waste of time.
c125_10_story3	Men speak with swords,\not words!

c125_10_victory	Let us go home together,\Rusalka.
c125_89_boss_long	A sweet love is as slumber...
c125_89_boss_short	On my soul I swear...
c125_89_bubble_prskill	This will settle it!
c125_89_bubble_skill	O light, be my guide!
c125_89_ctskill	Be still.
c125_89_death_1	Was my resolve...lacking?
c125_89_death_2	Rusalka...
c125_89_drive	My sword, grant me strength!
c125_89_hit_1	If it is for you...
c125_89_hit_2	Won't be long now.
c125_89_hit_3	That is much too much.
c125_89_hit_4	Ngh!
c125_89_hit_5	Kh!
c125_89_hit_6	Rusalka, hang on!
c125_89_hit_7	I won't give up!
c125_89_hit_8	Leave now!
c125_89_hit_9	I can't die yet.
c125_89_prskill	This will settle it!
c125_89_skill	O light, be my guide!
c125_boss_long	Let us fight fair and square!
c125_boss_short	There is nothing to fear!
c125_ctskill	Be still.
c125_death_1	Was my resolve...lacking?
c125_death_2	Rusalka...
c125_drive	Rusalkaaa!
c125_hit_1	Ngh!
c125_hit_2	Don't count me out yet!
c125_hit_3	Guh!
c125_prskill	Insolent!
c125_skill	Ahh!
c125_spa	The weather today is positively perfect\for a dip in the hot springs.
c125_startbt	It is time to test my valor!
c125_story1	Do your very best.\Love is earned only by those who have courage.
c125_story2	Worrying is nothing more than a waste of time.
c125_story3	Men speak with swords,\not words!
c125_true1	Master, I shall never forget your kindness.
c125_true2	*sigh* Telling someone how you feel...\It's harder than I thought.
c125_true3	I won't hesitate anymore.\I will tell Rusalka how I feel!
c125_victory	I swear on this sword!
c126_boss_long	I think you and I could be good friends.
c126_boss_short	I'll be your friend.
c126_ctskill	Don't ignore me!
c126_death_1	The path to true love is long and arduous.
c126_death_2	Aaah.
c126_drive	Lovely Sunshine Impact!
c126_hit_1	Ow!
c126_hit_2	Aaah!
c126_hit_3	Eeek!
c126_prskill	Lovely Impact!
c126_skill	Are you lonely?
c126_spa	I look like I'm enjoying myself? Heh, how did you know?
c126_startbt	Do you believe in eternal love?
c126_story1	You always seem kind of lonely, master. How come you don't have any demon friends?
c126_story2	There's no need to be embarrassed about never\having been in love. It's just kind of a shame.
c126_story3	No, I'm not. Everybody feels lonely sometimes.
c126_true1	I don't want to be hurt by those I love anymore.
c126_true2	When will I meet my one true love?
c126_true3	I get so excited when I think about you finding true love, master...\I just know it will happen for you one day!
c126_victory	Someday, you too will see how grand love can be.
c127_10_boss_long	Is what you see reality? Or fantasy?
c127_10_boss_short	Don't believe everything you see.
c127_10_ctskill	What a warm shadow.
c127_10_death_1	I must cloak myself...in even deeper darkness...
c127_10_death_2	I failed...
c127_10_drive	Think you can find me?
c127_10_hit_1	Ooof!
c127_10_hit_2	How could you?
c127_10_hit_3	Oooh, ouch...
c127_10_prskill	Mew!
c127_10_skill	Teehee.
c127_10_spa	Now, where should I hide next?
c127_10_startbt	Who wants to play tag?!
c127_10_story1	Huh... He's not as slow as I thought.\I can't believe he sensed my presence.
c127_10_story2	Well then...sweet dreams.
c127_10_story3	It's hard to see what's right in front of your nose. If you hide in your enemy's shadow, no one will find you.
c127_10_true1	Trust no one. Even the invincible cannot prevail over the sting of betrayal.
c127_10_true2	It's adorable how forthright you are. But that honesty is also a weakness. You need to be more careful.
c127_10_true3	I suppose you and I will be watching\each other's shadows for a long time to come...
c127_10_victory	Don't get careless!\Enemies could still strike at any time!
c127_boss_long	Is what you see reality? Or fantasy?
c127_boss_short	Don't believe everything you see.
c127_ctskill	What a warm shadow.
c127_death_1	I must cloak myself...in even deeper darkness...
c127_death_2	I failed...
c127_drive	Think you can find me?
c127_hit_1	Ooof!
c127_hit_2	How could you?
c127_hit_3	Oooh, ouch...
c127_prskill	Meow!
c127_skill	Teehee.
c127_spa	Now, where should I hide next?
c127_startbt	Who wants to play tag?!
c127_story1	Huh... He's not as slow as I thought.\I can't believe he sensed my presence.
c127_story2	Well then...sweet dreams.
c127_story3	It's hard to see what's right in front of your nose. If you hide in your enemy's shadow, no one will find you.
c127_true1	Trust no one. Even the invincible cannot prevail over the sting of betrayal.
c127_true2	It's adorable how forthright you are. But that honesty is also a weakness. You need to be more careful.
c127_true3	I suppose you and I will be watching\each other's shadows for a long time to come...
c127_victory	Don't get careless!\Enemies could still strike at any time!
c130_boss_long	Get ready for a once-in-a-lifetime concerto!
c130_boss_short	It would seem you have no talent whatsoever.
c130_ctskill	The din here is overwhelming.
c130_death_1	Somebody play Mozart's requiem for me...
c130_death_2	I-I can't hear anything...
c130_drive	Time for the curtain call.
c130_hit_1	Ha!
c130_hit_2	Ooof!
c130_hit_3	Such racket!
c130_prskill	I have no need for failures!
c130_skill	I need more grandeur!
c130_spa	That's it... I can feel inspiration coming to me...
c130_startbt	Thus the curtain rises.
c130_story1	Shut up! I'm sick of your voice!\It's nothing but incoherent noise!
c130_story2	I knew there was no hope to be found in a barbarian who doesn't know the first thing about art.
c130_story3	Be patient, demon. I'll write the most beautiful symphony ever made, just for you.
c130_true1	No ordinary person could ever truly understand art!
c130_true2	Admit that my music is the best!
c130_true3	Whenever I see your face, I'm inspired to write a new song.\Stay right where you are! I can feel a masterpiece coming on!
c130_victory	So, what did you think of this great composer's music?
c132_boss_long	Welcome to the party.
c132_boss_short	Just sit back and relax.
c132_ctskill	What a pain!
c132_death_1	Well, this sucks.
c132_death_2	Guess my lifestyle's finally caught up with me.
c132_drive	Now, let's have some fun!
c132_hit_1	Ugh...
c132_hit_2	Ah—
c132_hit_3	Pretty good.
c132_prskill	Don't overthink it.
c132_skill	Come on, loosen up!
c132_spa	Live it up!
c132_startbt	Let's have some fun. Right here, right now.
c132_story1	"Carpe diem!"\Seize the day! Live for the moment.
c132_story2	What's done is done, and there's no going back.\So relax, and don't take everything so seriously.
c132_story3	That said...I don't think it's a bad thing, sticking your nose in like this.
c132_true1	There's nothing more tiresome than someone frets over every little thing.
c132_true2	I know I want to live life doing whatever I want.\I'm just...not sure exactly what that is.
c132_true3	How would you like to be the Archfiend of Sloth?\The way I see it, all of the world's problems come from doing more than is necessary.
c132_victory	That was a great party, young man.
c133_boss_long	It's time to turn that frown upside down!
c133_boss_short	This is easy!
c133_ctskill	Smile!
c133_death_1	We could have been friends...
c133_death_2	I can't believe this is how it ends...
c133_drive	I'm deadly serious!
c133_hit_1	Yikes!
c133_hit_2	I'm not done for yet!
c133_hit_3	Ow!
c133_prskill	Get ready, 'cause here it comes!
c133_skill	Bored?
c133_spa	Teehee, this is kind of embarrassing.
c133_startbt	Nice to meet you all, weaklings!
c133_story1	So that's just how beautiful I am, eh?\Well, doesn't that just beat all?
c133_story2	Okay, then! Let's have some fun together!
c133_story3	Aw, that's too bad.\I actually meant it when I said I loved you.
c133_true1	There's nothing wrong with playing pranks.\It's your fault for falling for them.
c133_true2	You'll have to try a lot harder than that to pull one over on me,\weak little demon.
c133_true3	You think my pranks go too far? But that's how I show my affection.\Or is this just your way of trying to turn me down?
c133_victory	All thanks to me!
c135_boss_long	Let us do battle, one warrior to another.
c135_boss_short	Come and fight me!
c135_ctskill	None can surpass my will.
c135_death_1	Is this where I meet my end?
c135_death_2	Valhalla awaits...
c135_drive	Don't think of anything but victory!
c135_hit_1	Gah...
c135_hit_2	Eeek!
c135_hit_3	I'm not done yet!
c135_prskill	This strike speaks true.
c135_skill	Is that all you've got?
c135_spa	Who said you could look?
c135_startbt	Winning this battle will help me become stronger.
c135_story1	How do you plan on becoming the Archfiend with that kind of body?
c135_story2	Don't tell me you're giving up now! You haven't even gotten started.
c135_story3	If you're really sorry, then do whatever it takes to become the Archfiend.
c135_true1	If it's more important to you than your life, then risk your life to protect it.
c135_true2	I will become stronger. I won't let anyone take you away.
c135_true3	My job as a warrior is to do battle.\Yours is to become the Archfiend.
c135_victory	Maybe I've grown stronger.
c139_boss_long	I'm here. Like always.
c139_boss_short	You called?
c139_ctskill	Do I have to?
c139_death_1	I want to be here...
c139_death_2	Why won't you just leave me alone?
c139_drive	I remember everything.
c139_hit_1	Ugh...
c139_hit_2	Nrmm...
c139_hit_3	Leave me alone...
c139_prskill	I'll do my best.
c139_skill	Okay, first step...
c139_spa	I had a dream.\In it, there were butterflies flying around, and flowers blooming...and I was there, the same as ever.
c139_startbt	I'll stick to the usual.
c139_story1	It isn't anywhere.
c139_story2	It's just like the end of that fairy tale,\where it turned out that the blue bird was in their house the entire time.
c139_story3	Everything else had gotten so much better, but I hadn't changed one bit.
c139_true1	I'll always be like this...\I wish you would be too.
c139_true2	I'm just going to do what's asked of me.\So don't expect too much...
c139_true3	You surprised me, coming to my hiding place like this.\Haha, don't worry. I'm happy...
c139_victory	I'm glad that's over with...
c141_boss_long	Perhaps you and I are\destined to be together?
c141_boss_short	Don't worry, I'll find out who your love is!
c141_ctskill	Got 'em!
c141_death_1	How could you?!
c141_death_2	Guh...
c141_drive	All right, got 'em!
c141_hit_1	H-Hey!
c141_hit_2	Ow!
c141_hit_3	Aaah!
c141_prskill	Hold it! Don't you run away!
c141_skill	Stop right there!
c141_spa	Mmm, it's so warm.\Feels so good.
c141_startbt	I've got my sights set on your heart ♥
c141_story1	Oh, no.\I'm sure you'll find love someday too, Master. Just you wait!
c141_story2	That's not what matters.\The important thing is how you feel.
c141_story3	*sigh* I guess I really do have to teach you myself.
c141_true1	Don't give up! Even demons can find love!
c141_true2	I'm not lonely. Not as long as I get to show you love.
c141_true3	Love really does feel great.\Sure, it can hurt sometimes, but the good parts more than make up for it!
c141_victory	All right!
c142_boss_long	Welcome to the world of dreams.
c142_boss_short	I'll make sure your slumber is blissful.
c142_ctskill	I want to see your dreams.
c142_death_1	This must be a nightmare...
c142_death_2	I want to wake up from this reality!
c142_drive	Have you ever seen a bluebird?
c142_hit_1	...
c142_hit_2	What?
c142_hit_3	Am I dreaming?
c142_prskill	I hope you're ready to sleep forever.
c142_skill	Time for beddy-bye.
c142_spa	Am...am I dreaming? Or is this reality?
c142_startbt	Shh! It's time for bed.
c142_story1	I'm going to live forever in a world of pure happiness.
c142_story2	"The...Blue Bird."\Can I find the blue bird without dreaming?\Can I really trust him?
c142_story3	We'll live in eternal happiness with our beloved prince!
c142_true1	I had another dream today.\I was swaying back and forth on a swing in the sky, and I saw you above me, ascending to the stars...
c142_true2	Am I dreaming again? Or...did I already wake up?\Where am I right now?
c142_true3	I want to be happy, even if it's just in a dream.\Please, make me happy.
c142_victory	Sweet dreams, everyone...
c147_boss_long	Seems you've got a death wish!
c147_boss_short	Don't try to deceive me!
c147_ctskill	Come on!
c147_death_1	I'll get you for this...
c147_death_2	Gaaah!
c147_drive	Who wants to die first?!
c147_hit_1	Gah!
c147_hit_2	Agh!
c147_hit_3	Ooof!
c147_prskill	Do you get what's happening here?
c147_skill	Hi-yah!
c147_spa	What's with this tepid water?\Hurry and turn up the heat.
c147_startbt	Which one to squash first?
c147_story1	What's your deal, anyway?\Are you actually proud to be a demon?
c147_story2	Who's killing who now?\Just stay out of my way and I won't lay a finger on ya.
c147_story3	Gwahaha! Go flail around as much as you want!\I'll be right behind you!
c147_true1	I'll crush anyone who has a bone to pick with me.\If you want me to crush you, then by all means, come get some.
c147_true2	My pactmaker treated with you because you're a demon, right? Hmph.\You don't seem even remotely useful.
c147_true3	Hahaha! Just imagining a kid like you as the Archfiend is hilarious!
c147_victory	Who's next?!
c148_boss_long	This'll be easy!
c148_boss_short	Last one standing wins!
c148_ctskill	You're not getting away that easy!
c148_death_1	Grrr! You little...
c148_death_2	How did this happen?
c148_drive	I'll break you into pieces!
c148_hit_1	Aaah!
c148_hit_2	Wh-What the?!
c148_hit_3	Ow! What do you think you're doing?!
c148_prskill	I'll tear you limb from limb!
c148_skill	Are you freaking\kidding me?!
c148_spa	Aaah, that feels good!
c148_startbt	Ugh, now what?!
c148_story1	I'm going to be the greatest villain this world has ever seen!
c148_story2	Okay, so...thanks, but at the same time, I didn't need help, okay?\I could have handled it myself.
c148_story3	I haven't given up on being a super villain, though!
c148_true1	Don't even think\about ignoring me!
c148_true2	Becoming the Archfiend makes you famous, right?\Then I guess that's what I'm gonna do!
c148_true3	There's no way a Child can be a demon, right?\In that case, I'll just be a greater villain than any demon ever!
c148_victory	Ha! Too easy!
c149_boss_long	Did you come to hear me sing?
c149_boss_short	Okay...I'll sing for you.
c149_ctskill	Can you hear me?
c149_death_1	I guess my feelings alone weren't enough...
c149_death_2	Wait...
c149_drive	It's my turn to step up!
c149_hit_1	...Ow.
c149_hit_2	That hurts...
c149_hit_3	I'm sorry...
c149_prskill	I want to sing for you.
c149_skill	This might hurt...
c149_spa	I feel better now.
c149_startbt	I'll do my best for you...okay?
c149_story1	B-Before... I'm sorry I ran away.\I thought you wouldn't wait for me...
c149_story2	Tomorrow! I'll tell him how I feel tomorrow!
c149_story3	I came to talk to you about something.
c149_true1	I want to say how I feel...
c149_true2	But...what if he doesn't understand?
c149_true3	Come on, Rusalka, you can do this.\Right, then. Will you please hear what I have to say?
c149_victory	La la la laaa ♪
c153_boss_long	Talk about a cliffhanger!
c153_boss_short	Are you in the middle of an adventure too?
c153_ctskill	Now THIS is an adventure!
c153_death_1	Does this mean I lost?!
c153_death_2	How could you?
c153_drive	I refuse to give up!
c153_hit_1	Eek!
c153_hit_2	H-Hey, stop that.
c153_hit_3	C-Cut that out!
c153_prskill	You won't want to miss this!
c153_skill	Fascinating.
c153_spa	I guess the occasional hot spring trip isn't so bad either.
c153_startbt	Onward, to adventure!
c153_story1	Hey, don't you think you're wasting your time here?
c153_story2	Sure it does. This itinerary is carefully designed to develop the boss's mental fortitude.
c153_story3	That's right! Just thinking about the Infernal Realm gives me goosebumps.\I mean, it's still totally unexplored, right?
c153_true1	I just want to go somewhere far, far away. I don't care where.
c153_true2	I wonder what sort of world you'll take me to.
c153_true3	I'm tired of traveling on my own.\Why don't you come with me? It's not a real adventure if you know where you're going next! Hahaha!
c153_victory	Now, where to next?
c154_boss_long	I shall do my best. That is my role, after all.
c154_boss_short	I shall do my best.
c154_ctskill	No wrong shall go un-righted!
c154_death_1	Were my principles mistaken?
c154_death_2	This can't be right...
c154_drive	You're wasting your time.
c154_hit_1	Ngh...
c154_hit_2	Detestable.
c154_hit_3	Hands off!
c154_prskill	Go back whence you came.
c154_skill	So many twisted figures.
c154_spa	What are you looking at?\Is it so rare to see a Child taking a bath?
c154_startbt	Analysis complete. Commencing combat.
c154_story1	You don't seem to understand the gravity of your position.
c154_story2	Hmph... I can't fathom what either you or my pactmaker could be thinking.
c154_story3	I promise to lead you to the throne of the Archfiend, Master.
c154_true1	Why do you fret?\Simply stick to your principles, and the answer will be clear.
c154_true2	Do not forget what it is you must accomplish.
c154_true3	Tell me when you have made your decision.\I shall assist you to the best of my ability.
c154_victory	Just as I expected.

c155_boss_short	Raise your voices! Thank you for having me!
c155_ctskill	Let's be glamorous!
c155_death_1	What the...? Aren't you my fan?
c155_death_2	This wasn't part of the deal!
c155_drive	Time for the closing number!
c155_hit_1	Gyaaah!
c155_hit_2	Whoa!
c155_hit_3	Bah...!
c155_prskill	Listen up!
c155_skill	Where are you looking exactly?
c155_spa	Letting a star have a private life... Not a bad concept, huh?
c155_startbt	This is Echo's stage!
c155_story1	Since you made me,\you're responsible for me. Don't you agree, Manager?
c155_story2	This is my favorite singer's song.
c155_story3	Sheesh! Stop pestering me for a moment. No other fan club president\treats his idol so badly.
c155_true1	Being a star is quite tiring.
c155_true2	I'm going to shine so bright that I'm burned into my fans memories.
c155_true3	You're not the brightest, but you're still my fan...\S-So... I'll be nice.
c155_victory	Wasn't that show amazing?
c156_boss_long	I suppose this could do for a lark.
c156_boss_short	Go on, then. Entertain me.
c156_ctskill	Accursed weakling...
c156_death_1	Heady with the joy of victory, are you?
c156_death_2	So this is where my time runs out...
c156_drive	Looks like I'm up.
c156_hit_1	Curses...
c156_hit_2	You'll pay for that...
c156_hit_3	Aaah!
c156_prskill	The time has come to say goodbye.
c156_skill	Step aside.
c156_spa	It's good to be alive...
c156_startbt	Combat is one way of affirming one's existence.
c156_story1	Hmm... That tail of yours smells surprisingly good.
c156_story2	Humans are fickle by nature. Their desires shift in the blink of an eye.
c156_story3	Young demon...\I hope that you are the one to become the Archfiend.
c156_true1	To live for eternity...\Perhaps that was too audacious a desire...
c156_true2	I don't want this experience to end...\I wish it could continue on forever...
c156_true3	Something about you brings back fond memories. Perhaps we once met in a dream...\Oh, never you mind. It's not important. Heh...
c156_victory	Well done, young demon.
c158_boss_long	Sorry... You're not the prince I've been waiting for.
c158_boss_short	I don't think you'd make a good prince.
c158_ctskill	I'm only interested in playboys, period.
c158_death_1	I wouldn't have lost if we'd been underwater!
c158_death_2	Eeek!
c158_drive	Time to say goodbye!
c158_hit_1	Aaah!
c158_hit_2	Eeek!
c158_hit_3	Ow!
c158_prskill	Gotcha!
c158_skill	Can you swim?
c158_spa	I probably should get back to prowling for playboys,\but this hot spring is kinda doing it for me right now.
c158_startbt	I'm warning you now,\I'll never let you go!
c158_story1	You're not a guy, you're a boy.\You're still just a kid. But maybe in ten years, I'll have something to look forward to!
c158_story2	Since you're younger than me, I never really saw you as a dating prospect.
c158_story3	Yeah, but...I guess you're...not as bad as I thought?\Maybe?
c158_true1	Found a real hottie!\Now I just have to reel him in and make him mine!
c158_true2	Wait for me, my sweet prince!\I'm gonna catch you one of these days!
c158_true3	I gave it some thought, and...I don't think you're my type.\But you never know for sure, so I think I'll wait and see how things develop.
c158_victory	Time to go back on the playboy prowl!
c159_boss_long	Oh, you came all this way? How shameless!
c159_boss_short	Hohoho. It's time to have some fun!
c159_ctskill	Teehee! I feel great!
c159_death_1	No way. Here? Like this?
c159_death_2	Loki.
c159_drive	Are you watching me, Loki?
c159_hit_1	Okay, carry on.
c159_hit_2	Oh hohoho!
c159_hit_3	Not bad.
c159_prskill	Attention, everyone!
c159_skill	You didn't forget about me, did you?
c159_spa	Shut up. All is meaningless.\All but the words of Loki.
c159_startbt	Here comes Semele!
c159_story1	That's really harsh, Eve.\I usually appreciate your honesty, but I'm not in the mood for your jabs today.
c159_story2	He has a real, physical body.\I can see Him if I want to.
c159_story3	I can't wait to see you again...\My path, my beacon, my darkness, the one who holds my heart... Loki.
c159_true1	Can this be love? Hohoho! \Aaah... Loki, Loki, Loki, Lokiii...
c159_true2	My ultimate goal isn't anything as insignificant as becoming the Archfiend.
c159_true3	I don't think you have what it takes to be the Archfiend.\Only <b>He</b> can fulfil that role.\But you still can try, of course. I like watching worms squirm before I crush them.
c159_victory	I'm back, Loki!
c164_boss_long	I'll show you something far more painful than being bound.
c164_boss_short	Let me rule you.
c164_ctskill	I'll erase everything that stands in my way.
c164_death_1	Even when I'm gone...don't make nice with any other Child...
c164_death_2	Nooo!
c164_drive	Time for your punishment!
c164_hit_1	Indeed.
c164_hit_2	More!
c164_hit_3	Harder!
c164_prskill	Let me give you a squeeze... ♥
c164_skill	Just as I planned.
c164_spa	Wh-What do you\think you're doing?!
c164_startbt	You all need to be punished!
c164_story1	S-Stay back! Don't come any closer!\This outfit keeps me...relaxed!\I'm fine this way!
c164_story2	I suppose this means I have no choice but to toughen you up!
c164_story3	Hmph. It's fine, I'll handle it myself.\And someday, I'll even tell you how I feel...jerk.
c164_true1	No! Don't try to take it off! I feel more...secure this way...
c164_true2	I'll never, ever tell a demon how I really feel! Hmph!
c164_true3	I have to spell it out for you, don't I? But I'll just be talking to myself, so you don't have to respond or anything...\O-On second thought, never mind!
c164_victory	That takes care of that.
c167_12_boss_long	How will you look in your final moments?
c167_12_boss_short	We are all powerless before death...
c167_12_ctskill	Follow your destiny.
c167_12_death_1	I may finally find rest...
c167_12_death_2	For a time, I dreamed of a spring together...
c167_12_drive	Your life will be mine.
c167_12_hit_1	Ahaha...
c167_12_hit_2	Why?
c167_12_hit_3	The pain...
c167_12_prskill	Delight in eternal repose.
c167_12_skill	Do you fear me?
c167_12_spa	I feel so comforted.\Will my eternal rest bring me this same calm?
c167_12_startbt	Quake with terror.
c167_12_story1	Me?\Point a finger at you?\Why would I do that?\You're just a poor soul. I pity you.
c167_12_story2	I am only here to claim your life.
c167_12_story3	Have you finished your little tirade?\Then, let's start the Trial of the Future.
c167_12_true1	You know not even your own fate...\How wretched.
c167_12_true2	So pitiful you are...\I shall put an end to your suffering.
c167_12_true3	However many I may face, it changes not what I must do.
c167_12_victory	I have extinguished yet another light.
c167_87_boss_long	Thank you for coming.\Shall we begin the festivities?
c167_87_boss_short	I missed you.
c167_87_bubble_prskill	For my master!
c167_87_bubble_skill	I've been waiting for this.
c167_87_ctskill	I hope I can help.
c167_87_death_1	I really wanted to protect you this time...
c167_87_death_2	I'm sorry... I guess this is it for me...
c167_87_hit_1	Ow...
c167_87_hit_2	Eek!
c167_87_hit_3	That hurts!
c167_87_hit_4	Ow...
c167_87_hit_5	Eek!
c167_87_hit_6	That hurts!
c167_87_hit_7	Ow...
c167_87_hit_8	Eek!
c167_87_hit_9	That hurts!
c167_87_prskill	For my master!
c167_87_skill	I've been waiting for this.
c167_boss_long	Thank you for coming.\Shall we begin the festivities?
c167_boss_short	I missed you.
c167_ctskill	I hope I can help.
c167_death_1	I really wanted to protect you this time...
c167_death_2	I'm sorry... I guess this is it for me...
c167_drive	I'll protect you, master.
c167_hit_1	Ow...
c167_hit_2	Eek!
c167_hit_3	That hurts!
c167_prskill	For my master!
c167_skill	I've been waiting for this.
c167_spa	I almost feel bad that I'm the only one enjoying myself this much.
c167_startbt	As you wish.
c167_story1	Instead of talking about fighting,\or the Archfiend Contest yet again, why don't we talk about something fun?
c167_story2	So...please don't hesitate to call on me.\I'm here for you whenever you need me.
c167_story3	I'm sure you have a long life ahead of you.\Incidentally, I wonder what springtime is like for demons...
c167_true1	To be honest, I think I was actually pretty happy, even when I was human.\But don't tell anyone that...
c167_true2	Welcome home, master. How was your day?\Did you do anything fun?
c167_true3	Hello there. It's good to finally see you again.\I know there's no telling what life may have in store, but in the meantime, I hope you'll let me stay by your side.
c167_victory	It's all thanks to you, master.
c169_boss_long	Want some of my chocolates?
c169_boss_short	I want to see what lies within your heart.
c169_ctskill	I'll remember this!
c169_death_1	Waaah! You're not getting any chocolate now!
c169_death_2	Aaah.
c169_drive	Bittersweet!
c169_hit_1	Ow!
c169_hit_2	Hey!
c169_hit_3	Waaah.
c169_prskill	Here's how I feel about you!
c169_skill	Hehe.
c169_spa	All of my chocolate melted... *sniff*
c169_startbt	Do you like chocolate?
c169_story1	Hehe... Do you like chocolate?
c169_story2	But...aren't you embarrassed? You know, to say\thank you?
c169_story3	Do you know why chocolate is so yummy? It's because it's made with love.\All of my chocolates are, in fact!
c169_true1	Do you like chocolate, master?\Shall I make some for you?
c169_true2	I made some chocolate just for you, master!\It's the best chocolate in the world! You'll try some, right?
c169_true3	Give me a kiss if I win!
c169_victory	I did it!
c172_boss_long	Will you show me your sadness?
c172_boss_short	I can feel your misery.
c172_ctskill	This might hurt a bit.
c172_death_1	I guess my light didn't get through...
c172_death_2	I'm sorry, everyone...
c172_drive	Hope will never die!
c172_hit_1	Aaah!
c172_hit_2	Eeek!
c172_hit_3	I'm going to win!
c172_prskill	The light awaits me!
c172_skill	I'm sorry.
c172_spa	Getting clean makes your heart feel lighter.
c172_startbt	I heard your voice...
c172_story1	I have some interest in the young demon as well.
c172_story2	Good luck. I'll always be watching over you.
c172_story3	Thank you. I appreciate it, you know?
c172_true1	You can try to hide it, but sadness always shows through.
c172_true2	Will you tell me something special about yourself?
c172_true3	You don't have to handle everything on your own. Even demons struggle with loneliness...
c172_victory	You really are amazing!
c173_boss_long	This had better be fun.
c173_boss_short	Well, this looks boring...
c173_ctskill	I'm already tired of this.
c173_death_1	Hey... This isn't fun at all...
c173_death_2	I just wanted to have fun...
c173_drive	Are you having fun?
c173_hit_1	Ow...
c173_hit_2	Guh...
c173_hit_3	Eee!
c173_prskill	That was fun.
c173_skill	Wanna play with me?
c173_spa	Getting in a hot spring is more fun than I thought it would be.
c173_startbt	Let's have some fun, 'kay?
c173_story1	Come on, can't we just talk? All the other demons are busy with the Archfiend Contest, and you're obviously not doing anything.
c173_story2	Whatcha doing, master? Is that some kind of new game?\Looks pretty weird to me...
c173_story3	Man, what a weird Child she is.\Not that I care.
c173_true1	I hate grown-ups. All they do is nag, nag, nag.
c173_true2	I'm just doing what feels good. What's wrong with that?
c173_true3	I hope you can become the Archfiend, master. Then those preachy succubi will finally leave me alone...\Hey, are you listening to me?
c173_victory	Let's play something else next time.
c174_boss_long	At last, it's time! Your midnight partner, A.I, is here!
c174_boss_short	This battle is brought to you by Channel Evil, your number one source for live combat action!
c174_ctskill	Photo op!
c174_death_1	Thanks for watching!
c174_death_2	Tune in next time!
c174_drive	Time to crank up the ratings!
c174_hit_1	Owww!
c174_hit_2	Ooof, A.I takes a direct hit!
c174_hit_3	Not the face, not the face!
c174_prskill	That MVP award is mine!
c174_skill	Interview time!
c174_spa	Ahh, I didn't realize how worn out I was until just now...\I guess a little self-care really can go a long way.
c174_startbt	Your midnight partner here, reporting live from the scene of the battle!
c174_story1	Hi there! It's me, your midnight partner, A.I!\This report is brought to you by Channel Evil, your number one source for live combat action!
c174_story2	At last, it's here! The fierce battle royale between voracious demons!\And what's this? We'll be giving away a fabulous gift to all participants! It'll be sure to satisfy even the greediest demons!
c174_story3	A.I is only supposed to drink vitamin water, okay?\Don't forget that!
c174_true1	A.I will always be with you!\Just tune in to Channel Evil whenever you're lonely or bored!
c174_true2	All I want to do today is lay around and pig out on snac— Oh, er, hi there! It's me, your midnight partner, A.I!
c174_true3	Life deserves to be lived with all the fun and glamour of TV!\That goes for you demons, too! You can count on my continued coverage of your demonic exploits!
c174_victory	I guess this means I have to prepare a victory speech!
c175_boss_long	Who do you fight for?
c175_boss_short	There is only one reason I fight.
c175_ctskill	Now I know what I'm up against.
c175_death_1	Forgive me, my master...
c175_death_2	If I must give my life in service, so be it...
c175_drive	Time to end this!
c175_hit_1	Gah!
c175_hit_2	I got careless!
c175_hit_3	It's just a scratch!
c175_prskill	On my honor as a knight!
c175_skill	Is that all?
c175_spa	A true knight must remain ever vigilant, even at times like these.
c175_startbt	I shall fight you on equal ground.
c175_story1	You are absolutely correct, my master.
c175_story2	Thank you, my master.
c175_story3	Please, pay me no heed.
c175_true1	One cannot protect anyone without power.
c175_true2	I need power to protect those who are dear to me...
c175_true3	I fight for one reason only! My master!
c175_victory	I dedicate this victory to you, master!
c176_boss_long	At last, the final battle!\Now you face me!
c176_boss_short	Let the deathmatch begin!
c176_ctskill	I'm gonna win!
c176_death_1	Guess this is game over...
c176_death_2	Looks like my luck ran out... Aaah, master...
c176_drive	Time to show my hand.
c176_hit_1	Ugh!
c176_hit_2	Seriously!
c176_hit_3	Hey!
c176_prskill	Looking good!
c176_skill	Let's do this!
c176_spa	This is like the lap of luxury!\And it's all thanks to you.
c176_startbt	Let's get the next game going!
c176_story1	Haha, that's right. My masters died a long time ago.\...All three of them are gone for good.
c176_story2	Even if I get attacked and end up bleeding to death in a gutter, you don't have to worry about me. Got it?
c176_story3	Come on, folks! Don't be shy!\This is the start of a game that will never end!\The loser is whoever gives up first. How about it?
c176_true1	My first master was a really young demon.\Kind of like you...
c176_true2	In the Night World, you've gotta pay attention to what's beneath everyone's clothes. By that I mean the contents of their pockets, of course.
c176_true3	You know that I've had a lot of different masters, right?\So...are you sure you still want me to be your Child? If you are, I'll let you try the greatest game ever!
c176_victory	Looks like the house wins again.
c178_boss_long	I'm your mirage—a phantom who will soon disappear.
c178_boss_short	Don't trust in mirages.
c178_ctskill	Teehee.
c178_death_1	You got me...
c178_death_2	Now I fade...just like an illusion...
c178_drive	Let me show you a beautiful illusion.
c178_hit_1	Aaah!
c178_hit_2	Ooof!
c178_hit_3	You can see me?
c178_prskill	A mirage...
c178_skill	I'm over here.
c178_spa	We're not going to play tag today?
c178_startbt	Hello. Here I am.
c178_story1	Maybe...if you were able to catch me,\I'd feel a little warmer towards you...
c178_story2	If you were to catch me...\What would you do?
c178_story3	That...is a secret.
c178_true1	It's okay if you forget about me... I'll forget about you too, someday...
c178_true2	Come on, let's play tag.
c178_true3	You don't have to look for me.\Even if you can't see me, I'll always be with you.
c178_victory	That was a great game of tag.
c180_boss_long	Now, put yourself at the mercy of Lord Mammon!
c180_boss_short	Worship me!
c180_ctskill	Unforgivable!
c180_death_1	Now, the great Lord Mammon...lays himself to sleep...
c180_death_2	But...there is so much I have yet to obtain...
c180_drive	Ha-ha-ha-ha!
c180_hit_1	Aaah!
c180_hit_2	Do you not know who I am?!
c180_hit_3	Aaargh!
c180_prskill	Know your place!
c180_skill	How dare you!
c180_spa	Marvelous! Simply marvelous! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
c180_startbt	Gaze upon the king of kings, Lord Mammon!
c180_story1	What a fooolish notion! Weep, rejoice, and obey...\Or perhaps you are some form of insurrectionist?
c180_story2	Alas... Love is a steep and treacherous road.
c180_story3	It will not do! Why must it be thus!
c180_true1	None may take what is rightfully mine!
c180_true2	There is a hole in mine heart that cannot be filled with wealth or treasure.\What must I do to fill this aching void?
c180_true3	If only I could win fair Mona's heart, I wouldst forego all and lose nothing!\Alas...my heart doth swell to bursting!
c180_victory	A toast to my victory!
c183_boss_long	Kneel. This is a holy place.
c183_boss_short	Kneel!
c183_ctskill	Lower your head.
c183_death_1	You dare defy a god?
c183_death_2	Ridiculous.
c183_drive	Begone with you!
c183_hit_1	Ngh...
c183_hit_2	Don't touch me!
c183_hit_3	You'll regret that...
c183_prskill	This is my destiny.
c183_skill	Return whence you belong.
c183_spa	Even a goddess needs to rest.
c183_startbt	Kneel before me.
c183_story1	Present me with an offering worthy of God.
c183_story2	...How dare you so casually call my name.
c183_story3	May the light of maternal love light your way...
c183_true1	You fool. Why can you not see the truth?
c183_true2	Even a god cannot simply run from fate.
c183_true3	This world is beholden to laws unseen.\Accept your fate.
c183_victory	Exalt in my victory.
c184_boss_long	Uh, I don't really have time for this, you know.
c184_boss_short	Do you know where the nearest paradise is?
c184_ctskill	Off to paradise!
c184_death_1	Aww, no way!\I haven't made a single dream come true yet...
c184_death_2	I wish I could've seen the sea one last time...
c184_drive	For freedom!
c184_hit_1	Aaah!
c184_hit_2	Ow!
c184_hit_3	What's the big idea?!
c184_prskill	Stay out of my way!
c184_skill	Hard to starboard!
c184_spa	As far as paradises go, this one's not bad.\Aaah, that feels good... ♪
c184_startbt	Keep her steady♪\Set sail for paradise!
c184_story1	I may have failed today,\but I promise I'll escape next time!
c184_story2	Yo ho ho! At last, I made my escape!\Hard to starboard for paradise!
c184_story3	Yo ho ho! It's the ocean! Yaaay!
c184_true1	I may have failed to escape,\but I'm not gonna give up here!
c184_true2	I wonder where my perfect paradise could be.\I'm not gonna give up until I find it!
c184_true3	I always thought I'd find paradise somewhere far away, but maybe it's actually closer than I thought.\Right, Mr. Devil ♪
c184_victory	Now, come on! Time's a-wasting!
c186_boss_long	Such a sassy dog.
c186_boss_short	Do you really think you can defeat me?
c186_ctskill	Shush!
c186_death_1	Im... Impossible...
c186_death_2	That's no fun at all.
c186_drive	Sic 'em, Lovely!
c186_hit_1	Well, look who's acting brave.
c186_hit_2	Aww...
c186_hit_3	Tch...
c186_prskill	Are you so desperate to get punished?
c186_skill	You know you need to behave.
c186_spa	That made me feel amazing. I think someone deserves a treat.
c186_startbt	Give it a go. Tell me what you'd have me do.
c186_story1	I can't get enough of that defiant attitude.\Makes me want to break you with any means necessary.
c186_story2	A puppy will grow as it's raised. ♥
c186_story3	If you work extra hard,\even you could turn into an awesome master.
c186_true1	I've no love for little ones who don't listen.
c186_true2	Are you forgetting where you stand?
c186_true3	Could you tame me, do you think?\Don't tell me you're getting scared now.\I'll go easy on you, so come at me!
c186_victory	Well done.
c187_89_boss_long	Welcome to my waters.
c187_89_boss_short	Entrust your body to my waves.
c187_89_bubble_prskill	Ngh... Agh...
c187_89_bubble_skill	Clrosh shorosh...
c187_89_ctskill	The sea is darker than death itself.
c187_89_death_1	Like once vibrant ripples upon a pond, now I fade...
c187_89_death_2	Deeper and deeper...
c187_89_drive	Oh sorrowful soul, sleep!
c187_89_hit_1	What is...
c187_89_hit_2	Be careful.
c187_89_hit_3	Aaah!
c187_89_hit_4	Phew...
c187_89_hit_5	H-Hey!
c187_89_hit_6	Ooof!
c187_89_hit_7	Gyah!
c187_89_hit_8	Stop that!
c187_89_hit_9	Ngh...
c187_89_prskill	Your pain has not yet ended!
c187_89_skill	Share in my sea of grief!
c187_boss_long	Come sink with me to the quiet ocean floor.
c187_boss_short	Have you come to dry my tears?
c187_ctskill	Allow me to express my condolences.
c187_death_1	After all of this, this is...the path I've come to.
c187_death_2	Aaah...
c187_drive	Into the abyss with you!
c187_hit_1	Aaah!
c187_hit_2	Ahhh!
c187_hit_3	Aaah!
c187_prskill	Drown in a sea of sorrow.
c187_skill	Show me your sadness.
c187_spa	Are my tears not now obscured?
c187_startbt	After this ends all that will remain are your tears.
c187_story1	Yes. I didn't realize my grief was so great...
c187_story2	The water is so quiet... I can't hear a thing.\It's like I'm all alone, trapped in a sea of grief.
c187_story3	While what you said is a little...stupid. I mean, you made me feel better. Know what I mean?
c187_true1	I am the Goddess of grief...\Sorrow binds my soul, so I hide my tears by staying deep within the ocean.
c187_true2	Might this sadness someday amount to happiness...\Could I someday be so blessed?
c187_true3	Would you offer me comfort?
c187_victory	As pain grows, so does sadness summit...
c188_boss_long	I'll uncover any truth there is!
c188_boss_short	Don't run away!
c188_ctskill	You're not going anywhere!
c188_death_1	You think this'll make me give up?
c188_death_2	Aaah.
c188_drive	Bad guys get punished!
c188_hit_1	Aaah!
c188_hit_2	Stop that!
c188_hit_3	Aaah!
c188_prskill	It's gonna take more than that!
c188_skill	Get ready!
c188_spa	Wow... It's like my body is melting away...
c188_startbt	For Seshat!
c188_story1	The culprit is inside here!
c188_story2	But the truth must come out.
c188_story3	Shh! You're gonna blow my cover!
c188_true1	You can't fool me no matter how dumb you play,\demon!
c188_true2	Are there actually nice demons out there?
c188_true3	Come ask me for help if you ever want to uncover the truth!\I'll solve it with brute force!
c188_victory	Hahaha! Justice always wins!
c189_boss_long	You thought you could break the rules and get away with it?
c189_boss_short	Ready to confess your crimes?
c189_ctskill	No exceptions!
c189_death_1	Don't break the rules!
c189_death_2	I'll punish you for this someday!
c189_drive	Last chance!
c189_hit_1	Eee!
c189_hit_2	Ow!
c189_hit_3	Not bad!
c189_prskill	Time to repent!
c189_skill	You can't fool me!
c189_spa	I wish you'd take me to places like this all the time.
c189_startbt	Ha-ha, I'm gonna scold you SO badly!
c189_story1	How dare you lie to my face!\I know all about your crimes. Confess!
c189_story2	Well? Your affinity level for me must have\skyrocketed by now, right? Is your heart pounding with excitement?
c189_story3	Make him confess his crime, of course!\The crime of stealing my heart!
c189_true1	Don't bother feigning ignorance.\I remember vividly what you did to me!
c189_true2	Admit your transgression like a grown-up,\and then I might be able to forgive you.
c189_true3	You still don't know what I'm trying to get out of you?\Hurry up and tell me you love me, you stupid, thick-headed demon!
c189_victory	Repent!
c190_boss_long	"You are the ones who will be dying today." Yeah, that sounds good. Aaand...roll cameras!
c190_boss_short	Whoever wins gets to play the hero!
c190_ctskill	Current role: greatest warrior of all time!
c190_death_1	I guess my dream won't be coming true...
c190_death_2	Guess this means it's time to resign.
c190_drive	Current role: nurse on the battlefield!
c190_hit_1	Waaah.
c190_hit_2	Ow ow ow!
c190_hit_3	That really did hurt...
c190_prskill	I do my own stunts!
c190_skill	This is no act!
c190_spa	An actress's skin is as important as her acting.\Aaah, this should do wonders for it ♪
c190_startbt	It's a hard role to play, but very fulfilling!
c190_story1	Really?! Was my acting THAT good?!
c190_story2	You have to forget about shame. Confidence is crucial to acting!
c190_story3	In the end, he's just too darn shy, isn't he?\I guess Romeo and Juliet WAS a bit much...
c190_true1	Prepare to witness the greatest\performance the world has ever seen!
c190_true2	I don't think there's any demon out there who can play lazy, cowardly, and pathetic like you can!
c190_true3	Master...do you like romantic movies? I'm going to see one to help improve my acting.\Would you come with me?
c190_victory	I'll take you to a much grander stage!
c191_boss_long	Bring it on! Let's have some fun.
c191_boss_short	Bring it on!
c191_ctskill	Hot hot hot!
c191_death_1	I lost? No way.
c191_death_2	Ugh...
c191_drive	Grit your teeth!
c191_hit_1	Oh?
c191_hit_2	Yes.
c191_hit_3	Huh?
c191_prskill	Weakling!
c191_skill	Haaah!
c191_spa	Mmm, that feels good!
c191_startbt	Let's play together. What do you say?
c191_story1	You're still just a kid.\You think that kind of half-assed effort is going to get you the Archfiend's seat?
c191_story2	What would be the point of fighting someone who doesn't know what true strength is?
c191_story3	It'll be a hassle...but that's what comes when you get a flunky capable of standing on his own two feet, rather than a master... Understand?
c191_true1	Call me Big Bro!
c191_true2	No more talk! Say what you have to say with your fists.
c191_true3	I'll stop calling you "kid" once you're the Archfiend.\Right now, you're still just a kid! Hahaha!
c191_victory	There's still plenty of room for improvement.
c193_10_boss_long	Heed my words!
c193_10_boss_short	Let there be confusion among you!
c193_10_ctskill	Back to the cycle of death!
c193_10_death_1	Devote yourself to Tathagata.
c193_10_death_2	Teacher...
c193_10_drive	Devote yourself to Vasubandhu and the saints!
c193_10_hit_1	Don't ignore me!
c193_10_hit_2	Gaaah!
c193_10_hit_3	Guh!
c193_10_prskill	Enter Nirvana!
c193_10_skill	Be reborn in paradise!
c193_10_spa	Hmph! Do you think I'd be ashamed in front of demons?\I'm not blushing, you know.\My face just got red from the heat.
c193_10_startbt	Follow along!
c193_10_story1	You should know just how iffy I can be.\You were kind enough to make me your student,\but you know no one else\would've given me the time of day.
c193_10_story2	So long as I am alive in this world,\he will never disappear.\I won't let him.
c193_10_story3	He said returning good for good is the right thing to do,\so you can rest assured I will return the favor.\He'd understand,\even if I had a demon for a master.
c193_10_true1	Hmmm... Don't interrupt me. I'm meditating!\Hmmm... Ack!\I forgot the sutras!\I'm blaming you for this!
c193_10_true2	I suppose demons are good for something.\Hey, don't be conceited!\Never mind, they're no-good after all!
c193_10_true3	I know you're a demon, but how long do you plan to exploit me?\I'm only working with you because we share a common goal,\but once we find Teacher...
c193_10_victory	Hee hee!\Looks like I win again!
c193_boss_long	Foul demon,\be purified!
c193_boss_short	The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom...
c193_ctskill	Begone!
c193_death_1	I now return...\to the cycle...
c193_death_2	Urgh!\Ngh...
c193_drive	These are worldly desires!
c193_hit_1	Gaaah!
c193_hit_2	Ngh!
c193_hit_3	Aaah!
c193_prskill	Be reduced to ash!
c193_skill	Luminous mind!
c193_spa	Eeek!\Stay away!\Come no closer, demon!
c193_startbt	I don't like this, but I don't have much of a choice!
c193_story1	You should know just how iffy I can be.\You were kind enough to make me your student,\but you know no one else\would've given me the time of day.
c193_story2	So long as I am alive in this world,\he will never disappear.\I won't let him.
c193_story3	He said returning good for good is the right thing to do,\so you can rest assured I will return the favor.\He'd understand,\even if I had a demon for a master.
c193_true1	Act righteous in front of me all you want.\I can see perfectly clearly\the evil nature you try to conceal!
c193_true2	I won't disappoint Teacher.\This is all my fault, after all.\None of this would've happened\if I'd been there protecting him till the end.
c193_true3	Help me, demon.\You're the only one I can—\no, I'm the only one I can trust.\Nothing matters to me more than Teacher.
c193_victory	I'm going to win, obviously!
c194_boss_long	I hope you'll make this fun for me...
c194_boss_short	New toys to play with?
c194_ctskill	What an interesting toy.
c194_death_1	Must be...defective...
c194_death_2	Ha...ha ha...
c194_drive	I grow tired of this.
c194_hit_1	Insolence!
c194_hit_2	Urgh!
c194_hit_3	Agh...
c194_prskill	Don't tell me you're worn out already?
c194_skill	Hehehe.
c194_spa	Shh... No uncouth remarks, agreed?
c194_startbt	I can do whatever I want to them, correct?
c194_story1	Because becoming Archfiend is well within the bounds of "anything," you see.
c194_story2	Well, that's disappointing.\Why don't you just go on and say it, then?\You want to be Archfiend yourself, don't you?
c194_story3	*sigh* Now what do I do? I don't want to have to find a new toy...
c194_true1	Be honest with yourself, Master.\Every living thing wants something.
c194_true2	What could that demon be thinking? I just don't understand...and that's simply marvelous. How nice that I won't be bored for quite some time ♥
c194_true3	Why bore yourself hanging on to something as dull as justice? You'd have so much more fun if you just threw it away.
c194_victory	Now, where can I find a new toy?
c195_boss_long	I don't want to go back to my cage!
c195_boss_short	Please don't take my freedom away.
c195_ctskill	We can do this, Theron!
c195_death_1	Go on without me, Theron...
c195_death_2	Please don't be sad...
c195_drive	To paradise!
c195_hit_1	Aaah!
c195_hit_2	Aaah!
c195_hit_3	Eee!
c195_prskill	Let's go together!
c195_skill	Where could my paradise be?
c195_spa	It's so warm. Theron's enjoying himself too.
c195_startbt	Be a good boy, Theron. Don't eat anyone, okay?
c195_story1	Theron doesn't eat his friends.\Isn't that right, Theron?
c195_story2	Nonsense. Theron's a very good boy. He's\nothing like those other wild animals.
c195_story3	It's all thanks to you that Theron and I escaped our cages and began to dream of freedom.
c195_true1	Teehee, looks like Theron made a new friend.
c195_true2	Want to go to paradise with me?
c195_true3	Maybe I seem delusional to you.\But I really do believe that paradise exists...
c195_victory	I can't wait to see the paradise you have in store for me...
c196_boss_long	Ruffians who don't mind their manners get the whip.
c196_boss_short	Watch your tongue!
c196_ctskill	How rude.
c196_death_1	My face... Somebody, wake me up...
c196_death_2	Augh!
c196_drive	Know your place!
c196_hit_1	Heh!
c196_hit_2	What?!
c196_hit_3	It's not over yet!
c196_prskill	I'll make an exception and use my power.
c196_skill	How boring.
c196_spa	You want to try one of my apples? Don't say I didn't warn you...
c196_startbt	Enjoy it while you can. This will be the first and last time, after all...
c196_story1	"Beautiful Idun?" Is there any other?\Don't poison your clumsy prose with pointless words.
c196_story2	She could not handle a stern talking-to.
c196_story3	About earlier...\did you scold them for me?
c196_true1	I have a job for you: polish my apples.\I want to be able to see myself in them.
c196_true2	Are demons fundamentally incapable of holding their tongue?\I can't bear to listen to this.
c196_true3	I seem lonely, you say?\Heh...maybe I do, in a sense.\But it has nothing to do with you.
c196_victory	How long do you plan on hiding?
c198_boss_long	Master...you don't know how long\I've been waiting for this...
c198_boss_short	At last, the time has come...
c198_ctskill	Oh, did that hurt?
c198_death_1	You've just sealed your fate.
c198_death_2	It'll be your turn next...
c198_drive	Stay out of my way...
c198_hit_1	Did you do something...?
c198_hit_2	How annoying...
c198_hit_3	Ooof!
c198_prskill	We can have a lot more fun than this...
c198_skill	There you are.
c198_spa	Good. This is how you should be taking care of me.\This way, I can focus on being your deadliest weapon...
c198_startbt	Now, where did they go?
c198_story1	So why shouldn't you give me special treatment?\I am your right-hand woman, after all...
c198_story2	Hehe... It's also adorable how you try to be brave, even though you're quaking in your boots.\It's so cute I could eat you up...
c198_story3	But be careful.\There's no telling who I might end up hurting in the end...
c198_true1	It's okay. I won't hurt you.\Just kidding...
c198_true2	I'm not scared of anything. Trust me.\As if anyone would actually fall for that...
c198_true3	I'd love to see what lies within your heart, master...\Maybe if I swallow it whole and take my time digesting it, I'd have a better idea of what's inside?\Just kidding...
c198_victory	I'm bored now...\Let's go, master.
c199_boss_long	You came to see me?
c199_boss_short	Welcome.
c199_ctskill	Did I scare you?
c199_death_1	I'm sorry, Mr. Devil.
c199_death_2	Waaah!
c199_drive	I'll save you!
c199_hit_1	Waaah.
c199_hit_2	Eee!
c199_hit_3	Uhn!
c199_prskill	Teehee.
c199_skill	Shiny!
c199_spa	So warm.
c199_startbt	Hi there. How are you doing?
c199_story1	But I'm super cute like this, aren't I?
c199_story2	Mr. Devil, am I really that pretty?
c199_story3	I just really, really, REALLY love him!
c199_true1	I love you. You don't understand my feelings, though...do you, Mr. Devil?
c199_true2	I'm happy just looking at you. I hope we can be together forever.
c199_true3	I really, really love you, Mr. Devil!
c199_victory	Congratulations, Mr. Devil!
c200_boss_long	Nobody covers up the truth while I'm around!
c200_boss_short	There's only one truth!
c200_ctskill	Weak Points spotted!
c200_death_1	Truth is always cruel.
c200_death_2	Ngh...
c200_drive	It's time to reveal the truth!
c200_hit_1	Aaah!
c200_hit_2	Ugh!
c200_hit_3	Ow!
c200_prskill	Your tricks won't work on me!
c200_skill	There's something fishy here...
c200_spa	My glasses fogged up. This is why I don't usually go to hot springs...
c200_startbt	Time to put the pieces together.
c200_story1	You can't hide your crimes forever.
c200_story2	The truth always comes out.\The jig is up.
c200_story3	No matter how much you try to interfere,\they won't stop until their job is complete.
c200_true1	Did you think you could cover up\the truth with some shady trick?
c200_true2	All this time,\I thought you were just pretending to be a foolish demon./Turns out you really are an idiot.
c200_true3	One of these days, you'll need to face the truth.\As to whether you'll be able to accept it or not...well, that's up to you.
c200_victory	Can you see the truth now?
c202_boss_long	We both know how this is gonna turn out, right?
c202_boss_short	Wanna bet on it?
c202_ctskill	I'm all in!
c202_death_1	This isn't what I wanted...
c202_death_2	There's gotta be some kinda mistake...
c202_drive	I'm gonna take it as far as I can go!
c202_hit_1	Yikes!
c202_hit_2	Whaddaya think you're doing?!
c202_hit_3	Gah!
c202_prskill	You wanna do this? Let's do this!
c202_skill	Kapow!
c202_spa	Yaaawn...\Now this is paradise...
c202_startbt	I'm just getting started!
c202_story1	Hey now, what's with that face? You look like an old man who just found his runaway daughter or something.
c202_story2	No need to worry about me.\Revenge is one of those things where you gotta get the timing juuust right.
c202_story3	Maybe there's still a chance things can change.\You know what? I'll take that bet!
c202_true1	I'm luckier than you might think, you know.\As a matter of fact, that was the first time I ever lost a bet.
c202_true2	Wanna play Russian Roulette?\I'm talking with live ammo and everything!
c202_true3	Can you change your destiny? Pfft, of course not.\But if you think otherwise...we could always bet on it.
c202_victory	I knew this is how things would turn out.
c203_88_boss_long	It's not too late to turn back.
c203_88_boss_short	I'm not much a fan of conflict.
c203_88_bubble_prskill	Look out now.
c203_88_bubble_skill	That was sneaky.
c203_88_ctskill	I can't act like I didn't see that.
c203_88_death_1	No...
c203_88_death_2	I will get you back for this.
c203_88_drive	I'll protect you!
c203_88_hit_1	Ngh...
c203_88_hit_2	Aaah!
c203_88_hit_3	Ack!
c203_88_hit_4	Ngh...
c203_88_hit_5	Aaah!
c203_88_hit_6	Ack!
c203_88_hit_7	Ngh...
c203_88_hit_8	Aaah!
c203_88_hit_9	Ack!
c203_88_prskill	Look out now.
c203_88_skill	That was sneaky.
c203_boss_long	It's not too late to turn back.
c203_boss_short	I'm not much a fan of conflict.
c203_ctskill	I can't act like I didn't see that.
c203_death_1	No...
c203_death_2	I will get you back for this.
c203_drive	I'll protect you!
c203_hit_1	Ngh...
c203_hit_2	Aaah!
c203_hit_3	Ack!
c203_prskill	Look out now.
c203_skill	That was sneaky.
c203_spa	This place is so... mystical.\I like it.
c203_startbt	Try not to get hurt.
c203_story1	I'd protect you, too, if you lived in the forest.\Never know when humans will go after you again, do we?
c203_story2	Oh, hello, kitty. We meet again.
c203_story3	If I called you Lady Erebus,\would you let me walk Lovely for an hour a day?
c203_true1	Demons torment the weak for fun.\I bet you do the same.
c203_true2	You can speak your mind. Animals can't.\You can't understand the anguish they go through.
c203_true3	When you're Archfiend, would you build a utopia\where everyone can leave happily?\There's no hope in this world.
c203_victory	Did you get hurt?
c205_boss_long	Huh? I'm the boss fight? Aw, I didn't want to be a bad guy...
c205_boss_short	You're going to fight me?
c205_ctskill	Hocus pocus!
c205_death_1	I'm going home!
c205_death_2	Please...help me...
c205_drive	Abracadabra!
c205_hit_1	Mommy!
c205_hit_2	Ow!
c205_hit_3	Stop that!
c205_prskill	Mumbo jumbo!
c205_skill	Yah!
c205_spa	Check out that spray!
c205_startbt	Let's start a new playthrough!
c205_story1	Try and catch me!\I've saved something fun for you!
c205_story2	Scaaary!
c205_story3	But I want to play with you!
c205_true1	Ugh, all you ever do is complain.
c205_true2	Are you mad again? Keep it up and your face will freeze like that, you know.
c205_true3	Come on, let's play! If you won't...I'll curse you!
c205_victory	All right! I made it to the next stage!
c208_boss_long	Come at me! I'll fight you with everything I've got!
c208_boss_short	Come at me, young man!
c208_ctskill	Come at me!
c208_death_1	I WILL return!
c208_death_2	Aaargh!
c208_drive	Firo Finisher!
c208_hit_1	Ugh...
c208_hit_2	Ugh!
c208_hit_3	Guh!
c208_prskill	Firo Attack!
c208_skill	Pow pow pow pow!
c208_spa	M-Mixed bathing?!\Wh-Where am I supposed to look...?!
c208_startbt	At last, my turn has arrived! Come with me!
c208_story1	I-I'm fine! This's nothing!\A scratch like this can't stop me!
c208_story2	Make me stronger! I'll come whenever you call!
c208_story3	That's right! This is my true form!\Shower me with praise!
c208_true1	Power! I need power befitting this body!
c208_true2	Focus!\That's the key to attaining greater strength!
c208_true3	The only one who can surpass me is myself!\I need more power! Passion will never lead you astray!
c208_victory	There is nothing this body can't do!
c209_boss_long	I-I think our eyes just met... Does this mean he likes me?
c209_boss_short	Are you interested in me?
c209_ctskill	Just where do you think you're going?
c209_death_1	This must be the bad ending...
c209_death_2	Nooo!
c209_drive	What's with that look?
c209_hit_1	Stop it!
c209_hit_2	Gah!
c209_hit_3	Hey!
c209_prskill	Stay out of my way!
c209_skill	Wait your turn!
c209_spa	Wake me up if I fall asleep, okay?
c209_startbt	Let's see what this story has in store, shall we?
c209_story1	Boyfriend? Girlfriend? Curse them all!
c209_story2	But I'm a writer.\Living in a fantasy world is part of the job.\What's so bad about that?
c209_story3	I'll make them into a master\way stronger than you!
c209_true1	Why do you keep looking at me? A-Are you in love with me or something?
c209_true2	I won't be taken in by men ever again! This time, I mean it...
c209_true3	Hmph! Men are all the same! Every last one! You thought you could fool me? Well, you can't.
c209_victory	Flawless.
c210_boss_long	You have guts, I'll give you that.
c210_boss_short	All bluster, I see.
c210_ctskill	Kneel!
c210_death_1	Did you think you could steal my throne that easily?!
c210_death_2	I shall never perish...
c210_drive	Gaze into the abyss!
c210_hit_1	Gah!
c210_hit_2	Ngh!
c210_hit_3	Gah!
c210_prskill	This is the power of royalty!
c210_skill	Why, you...
c210_spa	How dare you peep at the Archfiend's body! Off with his head!
c210_startbt	Who dares interrupt the Archfiend's leisure time?!
c210_story1	Things have truly changed.\The contests I know were fought with blade and blood.
c210_story2	I cannot believe a fool like you is after my throne...
c210_story3	I shall allow you to inherit my throne.
c210_true1	Demons these days have no spine.
c210_true2	My crown is a heavy burden to bear.\Too heavy for the likes of your empty head.
c210_true3	As the times change, so too must authority.\At last, my reign is about to begin...
c210_victory	Now do you understand the Archfiend's power?
c214_10_boss_long	Let us spin the wheel of destiny,\and see whose fortune it favors.
c214_10_boss_short	This is the greatest gamble of my life!
c214_10_ctskill	It seems you misjudged me.
c214_10_death_1	Ah, now I see...\I lost...
c214_10_death_2	Waaah!
c214_10_drive	The goddess of luck smiles upon me.
c214_10_hit_1	Ooof!
c214_10_hit_2	Aaagh!
c214_10_hit_3	Ooof!
c214_10_prskill	Victory is within my grasp!
c214_10_skill	The dice have been cast.
c214_10_spa	Hmm... Not bad.
c214_10_startbt	Let us begin our wager.\We shall put our very lives at stake.
c214_10_story1	What an irritating little girl.\That cry of hers pierces the air like a ringing bell. It gives me a headache.
c214_10_story2	Unbelievable. The odds are completely stacked against you.\How long will you continue to struggle?
c214_10_story3	Do you truly mean to become the Archfiend?
c214_10_true1	There is no meaning in life for those\who cannot produce results.
c214_10_true2	Means are nothing without the ends.
c214_10_true3	I desire more power,\so that my victories will be that much more assured.
c214_10_victory	It seems that luck is on my side.
c214_boss_long	Let us spin the wheel of destiny, and see whose fortune it favors.
c214_boss_short	This is the greatest gamble of my life!
c214_ctskill	It seems you misjudged me.
c214_death_1	Ah, now I see... I lost...
c214_death_2	Gah! Aaargh!
c214_drive	The goddess of luck smiles upon me.
c214_hit_1	Guh.
c214_hit_2	Gah!
c214_hit_3	Ngh.
c214_prskill	Victory is within my grasp!
c214_skill	The dice have been cast.
c214_spa	Hmm... Not bad.
c214_startbt	Let us begin our wager. We shall put our very lives at stake.
c214_story1	Hmph, what a noisy little girl. Your shrill, piercing voice is like a church bell.\It gives me a headache.
c214_story2	I can't believe you. There is no longer any hope of victory. How long do you plan to continue this futile struggle?
c214_story3	...Do you truly intend to become the Archfiend?
c214_true1	There is no meaning in life for those who cannot produce results.
c214_true2	Means are nothing without the ends.
c214_true3	I desire more power, so that my victories will be that much more assured.
c214_victory	It seems that luck is on my side.
c216_boss_long	Did we meet on a whim of the moon?
c216_boss_short	Wow, you've made it this far, huh?
c216_ctskill	That hurts!
c216_death_1	This's my chance to jet! Bye bye!
c216_death_2	Ugh... You're better than I thought.
c216_drive	This's the end!
c216_hit_1	Owww!
c216_hit_2	What's that for?!
c216_hit_3	Meow!
c216_prskill	Isn't this fun?
c216_skill	Hahaha!
c216_spa	Awww, this is nice. Maybe I won't go home.
c216_startbt	Are you gonna be "it" this time?
c216_story1	Well thank you for coming and finding me.\I'll be sure to reward you, Kitty.
c216_story2	I have a riddle! "What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening?"
c216_story3	I can't waste this moonlit night cooped up indoors.
c216_true1	It's way more fun if you don't know where you're going!
c216_true2	You're a persistent kitty, huh?
c216_true3	If you're going to be so honest...maybe I'll play some real pranks on you!
c216_victory	Whaaat! But we're just getting started.
c218_boss_long	Oh, we've got a customer.
c218_boss_short	Welcome!
c218_ctskill	Are you happy?
c218_death_1	Hnnggg... Our house is destroyed.
c218_death_2	I must take care of my master...
c218_drive	It's time to clean.
c218_hit_1	Ouch!
c218_hit_2	Kyaaak!
c218_hit_3	That hurts!
c218_prskill	Uninvited guests are not wanted.
c218_skill	Knock, knock. Excuse me.
c218_spa	I'm so happy!\I wonder if my pactmaker has been to a place like this.
c218_startbt	Smile! Let's smile together!
c218_story1	Hah hah! Hello! Top of the morning to you!
c218_story2	Watching people enjoy my food is very rewarding.
c218_story3	It's not too bad, is it?
c218_true1	I just want a little bit of happiness.
c218_true2	Smile, Master. You look most handsome when you smile.
c218_true3	I'd like to get married in the Infernal Realm after you become Archfiend.\I want Venus flytraps for my bouquet.
c218_victory	Congrats, Master!
c219_boss_long	Do you want to die so badly?
c219_boss_short	Don't be in such a hurry to die.
c219_ctskill	I'm putting you on ice.
c219_death_1	I don't like this...one bit...
c219_death_2	Things got...too hot...
c219_drive	I'll freeze you to the core.
c219_hit_1	Ngh!
c219_hit_2	Damn...
c219_hit_3	Guh!
c219_prskill	My ice doesn't melt.
c219_skill	Getting chilly?
c219_spa	It's hot in here...
c219_startbt	Is that the guy you want me to freeze?
c219_story1	What a hassle. *sigh* Fine. I guess I'll make you more.
c219_story2	Good grief, humans are irksome.
c219_story3	Won't you trust me with it?
c219_true1	Hmph.\I was just thinking of where to use you.
c219_true2	You waste your time\worrying so much.\Just do whatever I tell you to do.
c219_true3	It'd be one thing if you were Archfiend, but as you are right now,\what good are you?
c219_victory	It's finally over.
c220_boss_long	Come at me with everything you've got!
c220_boss_short	As hard as you can!
c220_ctskill	My turn!
c220_death_1	It's okay. I just have to try again!
c220_death_2	Ngh...ugh...
c220_drive	Smaaash!
c220_hit_1	Aaah!
c220_hit_2	Ahhh!
c220_hit_3	I'm going to win!
c220_prskill	I'm gonna win!
c220_skill	Here goes!
c220_spa	Nothing beats a dip in a hot spring after a workout! Now, back to the grind!
c220_startbt	I'm gonna show you what I can do!
c220_story1	I see how this is going to be.\I'm warning you though, wimp.\Don't you dare underestimate me.
c220_story2	I'll tell you, there's nothing better than working up a nice sweat.
c220_story3	Tell me, wimp: Do you even have any goals for yourself?\Anything you're trying to accomplish?
c220_true1	I really can't stand that dazed look of yours!
c220_true2	Let's push forward together. You can't afford to stagnate!
c220_true3	You want to be the Archfiend because you don't have anything better to do, huh?\All right, whatever! I'll still help you!
c220_victory	That was a good match, don't you think?
c221_boss_long	Come! I shall be your opponent!
c221_boss_short	You called for me?
c221_ctskill	Away with you.
c221_death_1	So, this day has finally come...
c221_death_2	We all die alone, in the end...
c221_drive	I shall cleanse you from this world!
c221_hit_1	I let my guard down!
c221_hit_2	Ooof!
c221_hit_3	Damn!
c221_prskill	I'll take on all comers.
c221_skill	Take this.
c221_spa	Enjoy anything and everything to its fullest.\That is the way of the warrior.
c221_startbt	This is it! Everyone stay focused!
c221_story1	What do you hope to attain from humiliating me?
c221_story2	Such a beautiful moon.\Nights like these I feel a pain in my right hand. ...I wonder why.
c221_story3	More importantly,\you who have no connection to my past self that I hate\worked to help her.
c221_true1	You truly are a vexing young man.\But I take no umbrage with that.
c221_true2	I can't believe I've actually gotten caught up in the Archfiend Contest.\I never thought this would happen to me...
c221_true3	From what I recall of my pactmaker's memories, she was unfairly teased for having a colorful imagination...\But now that I am here, given form thanks to your power, I intend to repay the debt I owe you in full.
c221_victory	Heh, I won.
c222_boss_long	If you wish to defeat me, you must sacrifice that which is most precious to you.
c222_boss_short	How much do you go for?
c222_ctskill	Foolishness.
c222_death_1	How could you do this to me?!
c222_death_2	Aaah!
c222_drive	Your life is forfeit.
c222_hit_1	How dare you!
c222_hit_2	Ugh!
c222_hit_3	Aaah!
c222_prskill	Victory is mine.
c222_skill	Hmph!
c222_spa	I'm getting bored...
c222_startbt	You want ME...to deal with THEM?
c222_story1	I should never have made a pact with a pauper.
c222_story2	There is no one that gold suits better than my noble self.
c222_story3	No excuses. You made my precious gold\worthless; now you have to pay the price.
c222_true1	Never mind gold.\Even these pebbles are too good for you.
c222_true2	Do you know what it is I truly seek?
c222_true3	That which is beautiful, strong, and eternally radiant...\Such is my ultimate ideal.
c222_victory	Perhaps some gold powder would be in order?
c223_boss_long	Give yourself to the flow.
c223_boss_short	I'll finish this quickly.
c223_ctskill	I can hear the babbling of a brook.
c223_death_1	A stream that doesn't flow? Impossible...
c223_death_2	Ah... Downriver until the end...
c223_drive	Surrender yourself to the river's flow.
c223_hit_1	Dear me!
c223_hit_2	Oh!
c223_hit_3	Ngh!
c223_prskill	Don't follow me.
c223_skill	Stop it!
c223_spa	A short rest before I depart on my journey.
c223_startbt	As the river flows...
c223_story1	Don't be scared of bad dreams.\Face up to them\and you might learn something unexpected.
c223_story2	You should resign yourself to the flow.\For you're also no more than a flowing river\to someone else.
c223_story3	But you know, demon,\beautiful lakes come to be thanks to the rivers that flow to them.
c223_true1	Dust gathers on stagnant waters.\But waters that flow do not spoil.
c223_true2	Be like a flowing river,\a demon with an open heart that loves all.
c223_true3	Carry yourself well, demon.\As water changes its course\there will come a day when you cannot stop me.
c223_victory	My journey begins here.
c225_boss_long	Hey now, I wasn't expecting company.
c225_boss_short	You're not my type.
c225_ctskill	All right!
c225_death_1	I don't want to end things like this...
c225_death_2	But...I haven't even opened my presents yet...
c225_drive	Don't look away!
c225_hit_1	Ooof!
c225_hit_2	Guh!
c225_hit_3	That hurts!
c225_prskill	Here I go...for real this time.
c225_skill	You might want to dodge this.
c225_spa	Uh, where's the women's bath?
c225_startbt	Ready for some thrills?
c225_story1	Don't make such a fuss.\Even if I wanted to steal something,\there's nothing to steal.
c225_story2	Monaaa, forget about that stupid master and that awful woman and let's go on a date.\Just the two of us.
c225_story3	Try to be more positive!\If you look like Santa,\you'll become more like Santa.
c225_true1	Try not to space out. You never know when I might rummage through your pockets.
c225_true2	I'm so bored. Let's do something exciting!
c225_true3	I'm tired of searching for my old master...\Maybe I'll just stick around here.
c225_victory	This is fun! Don't you think so too?
c227_boss_long	Nice job showing up. I applaud your bravery.
c227_boss_short	I'm putting you behind bars.
c227_ctskill	Freeze!
c227_death_1	Hmph. To think this is where I'd make my last stand...
c227_death_2	Take good care of her for me...
c227_drive	This is as far as you go.
c227_hit_1	Aaah!
c227_hit_2	Is that it?
c227_hit_3	Not good enough!
c227_prskill	Time to end this.
c227_skill	Give yourself up now.
c227_spa	What? Even I take off my sunglasses off in the bath...\Is it really worth gawking at?
c227_startbt	Extenuating circumstances will not be taken under consideration.
c227_story1	Oh, that riled you up.\Maybe when the time comes you will be the kind of man who stands his ground.
c227_story2	You have quite the conviction.\And you seem to give priority to human life.
c227_story3	It seems you've come to understand why the Childs like you a little.
c227_true1	What is it? I was just about to head out on patrol.
c227_true2	Be brave. We are the only ones standing against the unlawful heathens who would oppose us!\If there is something you want to protect more than life itself, then you can't afford to stand still!
c227_true3	I know you've got my back. I'll go wherever your sense of justice leads you.\So, what are your orders, boss man?
c227_victory	Case closed.
c228_boss_long	Mild tea... or strong wine?
c228_boss_short	Do you like tea?
c228_ctskill	You're naughty.
c228_death_1	Oh no... Now my clothes are dirty...
c228_death_2	Aaah!
c228_drive	It's time to go back home!
c228_hit_1	Oh.
c228_hit_2	Aaah!
c228_hit_3	Ngh...
c228_prskill	Don't be rude!
c228_skill	Do you want to play?
c228_spa	Sometimes a cocktail is just as refreshing as tea.
c228_startbt	Don't stay up too late.
c228_story1	Boys are so simple.
c228_story2	Bonjour, enchantée.
c228_story3	Memories that give you courage... I'm sure you have them too.
c228_true1	Let me know if you need help, Petit.
c228_true2	Be my friend. I'll be yours.
c228_true3	If you're struggling, don't be afraid to say so.
c228_victory	Want to go enjoy some tea?
c229_boss_long	I knew you would come here, and I'm fully prepared!
c229_boss_short	There's a 99.99% chance I will defeat you.
c229_ctskill	There's no way you can beat this!
c229_death_1	H-How could I lose a battle fought on the field of information?
c229_death_2	How are you so strong?\This wasn't in my info...
c229_drive	I only need one shot!

c237_spa	Mm, I love this!\Hee hee ♪
c237_startbt	Okay! Let's do this.
c237_story1	She said because I'm too stupid to compete in the Archfiend Contest.
c237_story2	The book said photography means\drawing with light. At least, that's what Ailill said was in the book.
c237_story3	This is my first time in the Mortal Realm.\Now that I'm actually here, it's more fun than I thought.
c237_true1	Ooh! Perfect timing. Uh, how do you read this?
c237_true2	Medb, Ailill, and I go way back.\Must be a couple hundred years by now. Though, the number doesn't tell the full story.
c237_true3	I only meant to come here for a little fun. Never thought I'd stay this long.\Say, if you really become Archfiend, don't forget about us.\After all, that was the start of it all.
c237_victory	Did I... actually do it right?

c238_true1	The Mortal Realm is a lot more fun than I thought it'd be!\I think I'll kill a little more time here.
c238_true2	Ailill and Typhon are actually really cute, even if they CAN be a total pain in the behind.\They think of you as their beloved pupil too, you know.
c238_true3	Do you remember what night is like in the Infernal Realm? It's so dark and lonely that you pretty much HAVE to sing and dance to pass the time.\But here, night is so much fun it makes me want to sing naturally ♪ I wonder why?

c247_spa	What kind of hot spring is this?\Nary a flower petal in sight...shameful.
c247_startbt	Who dares interrupt my respite?
c247_story1	A queen has no use for friends.
c247_story2	It's a lovely day, isn't it? I do hope my pactmaker is all right.\She tends to run away when the weather is nice...
c247_story3	Surely you can see that if you do not quickly become the Archfiend, my standing also suffers.
c247_true1	You want to be the Archfiend? Can you truly bear the weight of the crown?
c247_true2	Dignity is something you're born with. Like me.
c247_true3	Even the way you walk is undignified. Here: Do as I do.\Royalty must stride with the grace of a lion.

c250_spa	Stop messing around in the hot springs?\Loosen up!
c250_startbt	I'll pull you underwater.
c250_story1	The Mortal Realm?\Hee hee, sounds kinda fun!
c250_story2	The shocked face humans make when you pull them under the water...\Hee hee!\I feel bad being the only one\to enjoy it.
c250_story3	If not for the beach, at least I have lakes.\And there are rivers, too. Plenty of places I can go.
c250_true1	I hope there are many fun things to do\in the Mortal Realm.
c250_true2	Places with lots of water are honestly the best.\Why aren't there any in the Infernal Realm?
c250_true3	It's hard to believe there's a castle on this isolated island.\I wonder who'd live here.
c250_victory	Can I go play now?
c252_11_boss_long	I was told demons are evil.
c252_11_boss_short	I don't want to fight, but...

c252_11_startbt	Did you call me?
c252_11_story1	Heh heh, now I'm not as scared as I was.\Thank you. But erm... could you stay with me until morning?
c252_11_story2	What? I can't do anything. I can't speak,\smile, or even cry.
c252_11_story3	I don't know what a blessing does. If it really makes people happy,\how come I'm not happy at all?
c252_11_true1	Grownups keep asking me for my blessing. I thought\you were invincible when you were grown up. I guess not.
c252_11_true2	The Kumari has to know everything. That's why\I can't ask adults questions. But I want to know what it's like to be happy...
c252_11_true3	Dear Goddess, was it your plan to make me\Kumari in the first place? Then, is my happiness part of your plan?
c252_11_victory	Whew... Finally, I'm done.
c252_88_boss_long	Om, to all Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

c252_death_1	Is this my way?
c252_death_2	How foolish!
c252_drive	Om, to open the Diamond Deva Gate!
c252_hit_1	This is meaningless.
c252_hit_2	Hmm...
c252_hit_3	Step back.
c252_prskill	Perish!
c252_skill	Cry.
c252_spa	Not everything you see is true.\Don't settle for momentary happiness.
c252_startbt	Oh Lord, let me guide the lost sheep.
c252_story1	Love can easily turn into attachment.\I cannot allow myself to partake of that aggrandizement.
c252_story2	I'll eradicate the demons to avenge my friends.\After that, I'll come find you.
c252_story3	Come on! Wake from your dream.\Find your way. The present is all we have.
c252_true1	If life is pain, then I'll take the road to death\and remove everything that causes me pain along the way.

c258_victory	Hahaha!
c261_boss_long	I await you in Heaven after your death.
c261_boss_short	Shall we meet in Heaven?
c261_ctskill	You will taste the agony of blossoming.
c261_death_1	Urgh...
c261_death_2	I must continue that person's work...
c261_drive	There are no Hades Flowers for you to use.

c262_prskill	You cannot avoid this!

c262_story1	But I really am glad.\Knowing that you like me\makes me wanna work extra hard!
c262_story2	Sure thing, Master.\After all, my role is to protect you\from any and all dangers.
c262_story3	Aw, look at you pout.\You look cute like that, too.
c262_true1	Don't be afraid to give me orders.\You are and always will be my Master.
c262_true2	Are you afraid?\Then hide behind me.\Your fears will all have to deal with me first!
c262_true3	Having something to protect makes me happy. And meeting you, Master, has been my greatest joy.
c262_victory	It's all because you cheered me on, Master.
c266_boss_long	Who dares awake the pharaoh's slumber! ...Just kidding.
c266_boss_short	Okay, who's first?
c266_ctskill	You let down your guard.
c266_death_1	I can't believe I let this happen...
c266_death_2	All that's fair must fade. Even the sun will go down someday.
c266_drive	Time to go all out for once!
c266_hit_1	Huff huff...
c266_hit_2	Pretty good.
c266_hit_3	Whoa!
c266_prskill	Step aside.
c266_skill	Yes, yes.
c266_spa	Is this all right? Ah, well...
c266_startbt	Hey hey, don't you think you're working your superior a little too hard?
c266_story1	Don't worry about me.\Just do whatever it is you want. Take good care of my queen, all right?
c266_story2	What is a demon if not persuasive? You'd better be taking notes, by the way.
c266_story3	If the queen figures out she's a Child and not a demon, she'll be furious.
c266_true1	The sands of time fall quickly.
c266_true2	So the Archfiend Contest has begun again.\Hm? Oh, just talking to myself.
c266_true3	Could you try to become stronger? If you don't, my plans will be ruined. If you find it impossible, I'll lend a helping hand, but do at least try.
c266_victory	I haven't lived this long for nothing.
c267_10_boss_long	Who dares awake the pharaoh's slumber!
c267_10_boss_short	I see a new subject has come.
c267_10_ctskill	Don't make me laugh.
c267_10_death_1	And so...I fade into history again.
c267_10_death_2	Nothing in this world is without end.
c267_10_drive	Hold wide the door and welcome your pharaoh!
c267_10_hit_1	Hmph...
c267_10_hit_2	Have you no fear for your life?
c267_10_hit_3	You cannot so much as lay a scratch on me.
c267_10_prskill	Pharaoh has come!
c267_10_skill	Move.
c267_10_spa	Ha ha, what a homely bath. I suppose I'll allow it.
c267_10_startbt	Come! Build the foundation of my empire!
c267_10_story1	There are precious few who could see the world as it is now and still claim with certainty that I was a divine being.
c267_10_story2	If they refuse me, I will simply wield my power over them, fully and completely.
c267_10_story3	Sit, Bast! You too, Horus. Have you completely forgotten your manners while you were asleep?
c267_10_true1	I've come to a world I don't recognize.
c267_10_true2	What kind of ruler do you wish for?
c267_10_true3	I also aim to rule. Do not trust me so easily.
c267_10_victory	Your ruler has returned!
c267_89_boss_long	You must pay for the crime of disturbing pharaoh's slumber.
c267_89_boss_short	Worship the sun!
c267_89_ctskill	Follow me, you dead!
c267_89_death_1	I had hoped to become...the undying sun.
c267_89_death_2	I will never give up.
c267_89_drive	Welcome to my Obelisk!
c267_89_hit_1	Move.
c267_89_hit_2	How dare you!

c267_89_hit_6	Aaah!
c267_89_hit_7	Hehe...
c267_89_hit_8	Insolent little...
c267_89_hit_9	Hmph...
c267_89_prskill	I shall grant you a proper reception.
c267_89_skill	The sun rises.

c267_hit_3	At this rate...
c267_prskill	Pharaoh has come!

c274_skill	It's mya turn!
c274_spa	What kinda game is this?
c274_startbt	Are we gonna play?
c274_story1	All you do is make people mad!\You've been a loser since the moment I met you!
c274_story2	Little kitty cat...\If you can't use your hand anymore, I'll go hunting for you.
c274_story3	And after all my dreaming, I could talk!\After dreaming, I met my master!
c274_true1	Show some respect to the grandma of all cats!
c274_true2	Whether I live or die, it doesn't make much difference to me!
c274_true3	Once the Archfiend Contest is over, I'm going back with my master! It's really far away! Will you come too, kitty cat?
c274_victory	I'm back! Weee!
c275_boss_long	Uh oh, I've got company.
c275_boss_short	Welcome!
c275_ctskill	How do you like that?
c275_death_1	Oops, you got me...
c275_death_2	Ouch.
c275_drive	Want a surprise?
c275_hit_1	Ouch!
c275_hit_2	Wah!
c275_hit_3	Amazing!
c275_prskill	I want more fun!
c275_skill	Hmpf!
c275_spa	Boo! No peeping.\Don't be a creep, Master!
c275_startbt	Ooh, I'm going to torment you!
c275_story1	What are you doing, Master?
c275_story2	Say that one more time,\and I'll make it my mission to make you miserable forever!
c275_story3	Okay, then let's grant my inept and foolish master\his wish.
c275_true1	You may be my master, but you shouldn't be so nosy.\It's almost like you're a stalker.
c275_true2	You demons should be more carefree.\In that spirit, would you care for an evening stroll?
c275_true3	You don't want to be Archfiend? Why not become Archfiend\and get rid of the Contest?
c275_victory	Whew, maybe I went a little too hard.
c277_boss_long	How would you like me to fight?
c277_boss_short	Beginning Battle Service.
c277_ctskill	I want to go home...
c277_death_1	Money is everything...
c277_death_2	Aaah.
c277_drive	Quitting time!
c277_hit_1	Eek!
c277_hit_2	Ouch!
c277_hit_3	Ow!
c277_prskill	You won't get better service anywhere!
c277_skill	Life is hard...
c277_spa	Would you mind not bothering me during my break?
c277_startbt	My battle services cost extra.
c277_story1	Just when I thought I'd finally made it out of\the Infernal Realm and into the Mortal Realm...
c277_story2	You know how hard it is for someone just starting out to make a living in this society,\right?
c277_story3	Oh, Lord Mammon ♥\Why don't you postpone looking for Mona,\and play with me instead?
c277_true1	Minimum wage? How the hell am I supposed to get by on that?\*sigh* It's not nearly enough...
c277_true2	If I had to choose,\I guess I'd take the world's weakest demon over Mammon with his gut and fish lips.
c277_true3	Hurry up and become Archfiend so you can also become my master!\It's the only way I can escape from Mammon!
c277_victory	Don't forget my bonus.
c278_boss_long	I'll try my best.
c278_boss_short	So be it.
c278_ctskill	It won't be easy.
c278_death_1	Finally, I can rest.
c278_death_2	Please forgive me...
c278_drive	Do I look so weak to you?
c278_hit_1	That was futile.
c278_hit_2	What a mistake.
c278_hit_3	That was unexpected.
c278_prskill	Let me try this.
c278_skill	Step back.
c278_spa	Kindness is always accompanied by an agenda.\What's yours?
c278_startbt	I can help if you want.
c278_story1	I pray to no one.\I don't believe in God. So this isn't praying.\It is...ranting, in a way.
c278_story2	Loki despises boredom.\I believe that is the only thing he truly hates.
c278_story3	It's just... I...\Let's just say I get lonely sometimes.
c278_true1	Loki is calling for me.\Don't you hear his voice?
c278_true2	What I think of Loki has no meaning\whatsoever. What does have meaning\is that I can't live without him.
c278_true3	I ask you to never defy Loki.\This is the only advice I can give you.\You will never be able to stand against him.
c278_victory	I feel rewarded.
c279_88_boss_long	Hello. My name is Laufey.
c279_88_boss_short	Pleased to meet you!
c279_88_bubble_prskill	Well then, let me give you a hug.
c279_88_bubble_skill	Are you Loki's plaything?
c279_88_ctskill	You're very funny.
c279_88_death_1	You're so greedy...just like Loki...
c279_88_death_2	I must go...
c279_88_drive	Loki is my everything.
c279_88_hit_1	Oh bother.
c279_88_hit_2	Try harder!
c279_88_hit_3	Oh?
c279_88_hit_4	That scared me.
c279_88_hit_5	That hurts, you know.
c279_88_hit_6	Oh.
c279_88_hit_7	Are you all done?
c279_88_hit_8	Satisfied yet?
c279_88_hit_9	That was splendid!
c279_88_prskill	Well then, let me give you a hug.
c279_88_skill	Are you Loki's plaything?
c279_89_boss_long	Hello. My name is Laufey.
c279_89_boss_short	Pleased to meet you!
c279_89_bubble_prskill	Well then, let me give you a hug.
c279_89_bubble_skill	Are you Loki's plaything?
c279_89_ctskill	You're very funny.
c279_89_death_1	You're so greedy...just like Loki...
c279_89_death_2	I must go...
c279_89_drive	Loki is my everything.
c279_89_hit_1	Oh bother.
c279_89_hit_2	Try harder!
c279_89_hit_3	Oh?
c279_89_hit_4	That scared me.
c279_89_hit_5	That hurts, you know.
c279_89_hit_6	Oh.
c279_89_hit_7	Are you all done?
c279_89_hit_8	Satisfied yet?
c279_89_hit_9	That was splendid!
c279_89_prskill	Well then, let me give you a hug.
c279_89_skill	Are you Loki's plaything?
c279_boss_long	Let me show you something interesting.
c279_boss_short	Ooh, I can't wait.
c279_ctskill	You're very funny.
c279_death_1	You're so greedy...just like Loki...
c279_death_2	I must go...
c279_drive	Would you mind going home now?
c279_hit_1	I was a little careless.
c279_hit_2	Well done.
c279_hit_3	Hehehe.
c279_prskill	I hope this is to your liking.
c279_skill	Ta-da!\How's this?
c279_spa	What a wonderful spot!\You're being so kind to me.\You must love me.
c279_startbt	Thank you for having me.
c279_story1	He's a frail person.\He needs love.
c279_story2	It was a gift,\so of course it means a lot to me.
c279_story3	You need not worry, Master.\Even if you abandon me,\I will never abandon you.
c279_true1	It's quite unfortunate.\Loki is such a wonderful person.\Why is everyone so afraid of him?
c279_true2	I have loved Loki\from the moment I was created.\He is everything to me.
c279_true3	You're not also trying to steal Loki\away from me, are you?\You know what I mean, I hope.\I wouldn't want to hurt you.
c279_victory	Are you sure you should trust me?
c280_boss_long	Your bad luck is my good luck!
c280_boss_short	Wanna play?
c280_ctskill	Don't worry, Mr. Demon!
c280_death_1	My happiness is all gone...
c280_death_2	Aagh... Aagh...
c280_drive	Fortune is mine!
c280_hit_1	Huh?
c280_hit_2	Ow!
c280_hit_3	Urgh!
c280_prskill	Now I'm mad!
c280_skill	I'm "it."
c280_spa	Don't look, little demon.
c280_startbt	Hahaha!\You need to be happy too, Mr. Demon!
c280_story1	Has my nightmare come true?!
c280_story2	I have to go to the sea to save the tuna!
c280_story3	If she's happy now...why can't everyone else be happy too?
c280_true1	This might be a tough question...
c280_true2	I'm not an angel of fortune.\But, will you stay with me anyway?
c280_true3	You have a wish too, Mr. Demon?\I don't know what it is, but I hope you're lucky enough to get it!
c280_victory	Haha! Are you happy thanks to me?
c281_boss_long	This place isn't for you.
c281_boss_short	Did you get lost?
c281_ctskill	I wonder if I can catch a glimpse.
c281_death_1	This... This isn't paradise...
c281_death_2	Hikari...run...
c281_drive	Can you see the light?
c281_hit_1	Ooof!
c281_hit_2	Waaah!
c281_hit_3	Ngh...
c281_prskill	You won't escape.
c281_skill	Shut up!
c281_spa	How did you know I'd be here?\You really do defy my expectations in surprising ways.
c281_startbt	We do it together this time.
c281_story1	You should reconsider.\You're a human. Do you think you are\any match for a Child like me?
c281_story2	A human life passes in a fleeting moment—\a moment rife with sadness and misery. They can boast nothing more.
c281_story3	Even if I'm wandering through the blinding darkness,\I feel like I'm in a world of broad daylight.
c281_true1	Oh, hello Master.\I was just in my own little world\imagining paradise.
c281_true2	If I ever make it to paradise,\I'll come back to you, Master.\But don't get your hopes up.\After all, there's no such thing as paradise.
c281_true3	Life is like running around\in a labyrinth with no way out.\And you have to keep running to stay alive.\Never stopping until you die.
c281_victory	It makes me happy if I helped, even a tiny bit.

c283_10_story2	You're more short-tempered than I'd thought.
c283_10_story3	No one but Master.\But if it's for Master, I might be able to...become your Child...
c283_10_true1	Don't play at being friends with me.\You're not my master...
c283_10_true2	If it wasn't for my master,\I'd be crushing demons like you...

c283_89_hit_3	What?
c283_89_hit_4	Guh!
c283_89_hit_5	This is a mistake.
c283_89_hit_6	Aaah!
c283_89_hit_7	Teehee.
c283_89_hit_8	Master!
c283_89_hit_9	Ooof!
c283_89_prskill	You'd feel better if you just gave up...
c283_89_skill	What a pain.
c283_boss_long	*sigh* Another customer to deal with?
c283_boss_short	Welcome. Dear customer...
c283_ctskill	So annoying...
c283_death_1	I'm so pathetic... Master...
c283_death_2	I guess I wasn't fit to be a maid...
c283_drive	Get out of here!
c283_hit_1	Aaah!
c283_hit_2	Ow!
c283_hit_3	Aaah!
c283_prskill	There's no way you can beat me.
c283_skill	A stubborn one, huh?
c283_spa	Where could master have gone?
c283_startbt	Who cares about battles between demons?
c283_story1	You don't mind...\if your own master loses to a child?
c283_story2	You're more short-tempered than I'd thought.
c283_story3	No one but Master.\But if it's for Master, I might be able to...become your Child...
c283_true1	Don't play at being friends with me.\You're not my master...
c283_true2	If it wasn't for my master,\I'd be crushing demons like you...
c283_true3	Don't disappoint my master. You must do whatever it takes to become the Archfiend.\Please...my new master.
c283_victory	I don't need your approval.
c285_boss_long	Futile soul, burn for eternity! \The undefeated legend, Endless Duel!
c285_boss_short	Your next duel's opponent is me, Natalis!
c285_ctskill	Here we go!
c285_death_1	The show...ends...here.
c285_death_2	Well...see you.
c285_drive	To the next battlefield!
c285_hit_1	It hurts!
c285_hit_2	I won't forget this!
c285_hit_3	Urgh...
c285_prskill	Consider this a service!
c285_skill	Okay, okay.
c285_spa	Hahahaha! Why are you so tense?
c285_startbt	The big comeback! Follow captain Natalis!
c285_story1	Maybe I should prank Channel Evil.\Get a little payback.
c285_story2	From now on, instead of that snore-fest Channel Evil,\the new Endless Duel will be broadcasting our duels live,\so stay tuned!
c285_story3	You don't need to be strong,\but please survive until the end. You got that?
c285_true1	The contest started, so the Infernal Realm is completely empty.\And Lucifaro is nowhere to be seen. If you want to meet fun demons,\you have to go to the Mortal Realm.
c285_true2	Hmm. Believe it or not, I do have a friend or two.\Don't group me up with the likes of you.
c285_true3	Do you know Brigid? I'm saying this just in case,\but don't befriend her.\She is my friend and all, but she's a little weird. Okay, really weird.
c285_victory	I have returned from the bloody battle!
c286_boss_long	What a tiresome customer.
c286_boss_short	Shall I help?
c286_ctskill	You're in the way!
c286_death_1	H-How could I have been so careless?
c286_death_2	Aaah...
c286_drive	I'll handle this!
c286_hit_1	Damn!
c286_hit_2	Ooof!
c286_hit_3	Guh!
c286_prskill	Mind your manners!
c286_skill	It seems there's cleaning to be done.
c286_spa	For the moment...\let's just say I'm satisfied.
c286_startbt	You need me, don't you?
c286_story1	As someone competing in the Archfiend Contest...\You have no fundamental knowledge at all,\correct?
c286_story2	Our new master is just a means to an end.\It'll take a little time to prove\I'm better than Lisa.
c286_story3	I'm only teaming up with you until the Archfiend Contest is over... You cheeky little fox!
c286_true1	In terms of raw sensual appeal...Lisa is a wonderful succubus.\Whoever she serves is sure to be no ordinary demon.
c286_true2	I've never doubted Lisa's judgment.\However...I do wonder why she chose you as her master.
c286_true3	If you were unable to become the Archfiend, that would damage Lisa's reputation irreparably.\So make sure you succeed.
c286_victory	Call on me whenever you wish...
c287_88_boss_long	Oh, will you be my partner?
c287_88_boss_short	Hahaha! You'll have to do more than fight!
c287_88_ctskill	Try harder!
c287_88_death_1	I'm not giving up just yet!
c287_88_death_2	Aaah!
c287_88_drive	There can only be one lead role, obviously!
c287_88_hit_1	That's it?
c287_88_hit_2	Is that all?
c287_88_hit_3	How disappointing.
c287_88_hit_4	Ooof!
c287_88_hit_5	Move it!
c287_88_hit_6	Aaah!
c287_88_hit_7	Guh!
c287_88_hit_8	Look at you go!
c287_88_hit_9	This is against the rules!
c287_88_prskill	I've about had enough.
c287_88_skill	I'll be the one to win!
c287_boss_long	Why don't you quit being stubborn and give in?
c287_boss_short	You don't know when to give up, do you?
c287_ctskill	Try harder!
c287_death_1	I'm not giving up just yet!
c287_death_2	Aaah!
c287_drive	Let my dance enthrall you!
c287_hit_1	Gaaah!
c287_hit_2	Ow!
c287_hit_3	Ooof!
c287_prskill	I'll show you just a tiny bit more!
c287_skill	This is nothing!
c287_spa	First, I finish up my intense practice session,\then I enjoy a brief moment of rest.\It's like I'm a real pro dancer, right? Pretty cool, huh?
c287_startbt	From now on, the stage is all mine!
c287_story1	I'm gonna keep leaping towards new heights,\and everyone'll look up to me!\That's why I need you to jump\even higher than that.
c287_story2	Hmph. I'm gonna keep running my way.\You do you. Prove you're the best\in your own way.
c287_story3	The reason why people make pacts with demons\is to get their wishes granted, isn’t it?\But all you do is say you can't do it.
c287_true1	I acknowledge you as my master now.\
c287_true2	You can't be the best\without giving it your all, is it? Well in that case,\I'll help you out so you can get there.
c287_true3	I'm your Child so it's impossible for me to surpass you.\That's why I'm gonna make you Archfiend,\then I'll be the greatest Child.\
c287_victory	Drown in your regret!
c289_10_boss_long	Let me see whether you are worthy of being cut down.
c289_10_boss_short	Let our blades clash!
c289_10_ctskill	How unruly!
c289_10_death_1	A shame...but I have no...regrets...
c289_10_death_2	Urghhh!
c289_10_drive	Sir Rufus commands it!
c289_10_hit_1	That all you got?
c289_10_hit_2	Not too shabby.
c289_10_hit_3	Oof!
c289_10_prskill	Don't waste my time!
c289_10_skill	I'll put you out of your misery.
c289_10_spa	Judging from the humidity in the air,\it's probably going to rain tomorrow.\Oh! I should take out my plants.
c289_10_startbt	I will annihilate the targets.
c289_10_story1	We will make Sir Rufus into the Archfiend.\That is our duty and the meaning of our existence.
c289_10_story2	Listen, you're in the thick of the Archfiend Contest right now.\You must never forget that.
c289_10_story3	So for now,\I must focus carefully on cultivating everything in my purview,\from the roots to the branches.
c289_10_true1	The Mortal Realm is a bore, but it is a good environment\in which to enjoy bonsai.
c289_10_true2	Luin may seem strict, but she's very kind.\It's rather fun to tease her.
c289_10_true3	If necessary, I can even make you Archfiend.\If Sir Rufus orders it, that is.
c289_10_victory	There is no room for doubt.\Victory is yours!
c289_boss_long	I will show you why I was given the name Durandal!
c289_boss_short	Don't even dream of escaping.
c289_ctskill	Watch closely.
c289_death_1	My sword...has broken?
c289_death_2	Guh... Ngh...
c289_drive	Taste my undying blade!
c289_hit_1	I let down my guard.
c289_hit_2	Kh...
c289_hit_3	Ugh...
c289_prskill	Don't underestimate me!
c289_skill	Out of the way!
c289_spa	*sigh* If you're free, join me.
c289_startbt	Understood. I'll stand on the front lines.
c289_story1	We will make Sir Rufus into the Archfiend. That is our duty and the meaning of our existence.
c289_story2	Listen, you're in the thick of the Archfiend Contest right now. You must never forget that.
c289_story3	So for now, I must focus carefully on cultivating everything in my purview, from the roots to the branches.
c289_true1	The Mortal Realm is a bore, but it is a good environment in which to enjoy bonsai.
c289_true2	Luin may seem strict, but she's very kind. It's rather fun to tease her.
c289_true3	If necessary, I can even make you Archfiend. If Sir Rufus orders it, that is.
c289_victory	I've returned.
c290_boss_long	You're early. I'll still welcome you.
c290_boss_short	How long will you keep me waiting?
c290_ctskill	How does it feel?
c290_death_1	You bring me such...pleasure.
c290_death_2	Hehehehe ♥
c290_drive	Let me see your pain!
c290_hello1	Welcome to the Scarlet Collection.\Look around at your leisure.
c290_hello2	That was so close. Hehehe. It really put me on edge, you know? I can't overexert myself.
c290_hello3	They say "a meeting by chance is preordained." That means in our previous lives we must have...! Teehee.
c290_hidden	There may be something useful for you. Take your time browsing. We've got all the time in the world. Teehee.
c290_hit_1	How funny!
c290_hit_2	So cute.
c290_hit_3	Teehee.
c290_prskill	Entertain me a little longer.
c290_skill	Is that it?
c290_spa	I never imagined this would feel so wonderful. It's like some unexpected sort of trial!\Mhmmm!
c290_startbt	I'm going first? Okay, well, follow me.
c290_story1	I have no intention of playing Lucifaro's game.\I'm not like you.
c290_story2	Give me a near-death experience.\Could you hack me to pieces like that demon did back then?
c290_story3	Scarlet Collection will always welcome you.\In many ways...
c290_thankyou	I'm not that interested in the Archfiend Contest. Demons, Childs, they get so into it. For me it just gets old, fast.
c290_true1	I won't be going back to the Infernal Realm for a while.\I'll be staying here in the Mortal Realm. At your service.
c290_true2	I dropped out of the Archfiend Contest partway through.\Kinda burned the bridge with that person. Teehee.
c290_true3	Normal love and friendship are so boring. I, instead, find it ever so lovely seeing your face contorted in pain.
c290_victory	Are you satisfied now?
c290_wait1	I have something pretty rare in stock today. I'll do you a solid and let you see it.
c290_wait2	Come again. You'll always find me here.
c292_boss_long	I will be your opponent.
c292_boss_short	Nice to meet you.
c292_ctskill	You're in the way.
c292_death_1	Sir Rufus...forgive me...
c292_death_2	What an embarrassing defeat...
c292_drive	Prepare for destruction!
c292_hit_1	How careless.
c292_hit_2	Gh!
c292_hit_3	Now I see.
c292_prskill	You will be punished.
c292_skill	Leave now.
c292_spa	*siiigh* ...Oh! I can't believe I...
c292_startbt	Please leave this to me.
c292_story1	You didn’t think that you were going to die? You're quite optimistic, thinking you'd simply return to the Infernal Realm.
c292_story2	Oh, Sir Rufus, just how long do I need to be here? I can feel the effects of being in this place already.\It's like it's doing something to my head.
c292_story3	As you wish, Sir Rufus.
c292_true1	Sir Rufus ordered me to gather information, but...is there really any value in that?
c292_true2	What in the world are you thinking? Do you honestly believe you can win?
c292_true3	Anything you do is useless. Sir Rufus is the only one fit to rule the Infernal Realm.
c292_victory	Just as I expected.
c294_10_boss_long	Tag! You're it!
c294_10_boss_short	How laughable!
c294_10_ctskill	You're not going anywhere!
c294_10_death_1	It's not over yet!
c294_10_death_2	Why, you...!
c294_10_drive	I'll kill you all.
c294_10_hit_1	This is what I'm talking about.
c294_10_hit_2	What's this?
c294_10_hit_3	You're so loud.
c294_10_prskill	You're not dead yet, are you?
c294_10_skill	Go away.
c294_10_spa	Heh heh. What? \Did you think I'd bathe in blood?
c294_10_startbt	Just do as I say.
c294_10_story1	You are my flower. The woman unrivaled in my heart!\Hah, so corny!
c294_10_story2	Don't expect me to do all I can to help you. \Or whenever it is you need.
c294_10_story3	Promise me you won't abandon me.\I'll protect you until you turn into ashes.
c294_10_true1	No one knows how to use me properly.\Nimrods.
c294_10_true2	Did you really forget me?\Seriously? How can you be so shameless?
c294_10_true3	You didn't find me. I found you.\As a matter of fact, what have you done so far?
c294_10_victory	Hah hah! That's what I'm talking about!
c294_boss_long	Now pledge yourself to me!\We'll be together for all eternity.
c294_boss_short	A blood oath...
c294_ctskill	Allow me!
c294_death_1	Time...to return...to ash.
c294_death_2	Farewell...everyone...
c294_drive	Behave yourself!
c294_hit_1	Did I miss?
c294_hit_2	Owww!
c294_hit_3	Gah...
c294_prskill	Pardon me!
c294_skill	Withdraw at once.
c294_spa	Hehehe...\Is something the matter?\Did you think I was bathing in blood?
c294_startbt	Allow me to guide you along the path of proper manners.
c294_story1	You are a flower blooming beneath the azure sky.\My ideal girl.
c294_story2	From today on I shall be known as Bapurry! Meow!
c294_story3	If you will be my sole ideal girl, then I will guard you until the very moment I turn to ash and waste away.
c294_true1	The Infernal Realm is a bore.\A realm where power is everything and the strong dominate the weak. There isn't an ounce of beauty in it.\That's why you came to the Mortal Realm as well, right?
c294_true2	For some reason, I'm often called a vampire.\I'm really just your run-of-the-mill demon, though.\Hehe... Maybe you simply desire a little nibble?
c294_true3	Demon who appeared so suddenly in my garden...\I'll shroud you with my flowers\so you can't escape.
c294_victory	Well done. Are you hurt at all?
c295_boss_long	I am Unknown?\Who am I?
c295_boss_short	Hehehe...\Hahaha...\HAHAHA!
c295_ctskill	Ashes to Ashes
c295_death_1	Sayoko...help me...
c295_death_2	Urgh...
c295_drive	It's alright. I'll protect you.
c295_hit_1	Deliver me.
c295_hit_2	Hee...\heehee.
c295_hit_3	Hah. Hah.\Eheheh.
c295_prskill	Who am I?
c295_skill	I won't forgive you, demon.
c295_spa	Urgh...\Is this hell?\Or no, heaven?
c295_startbt	Let us go.\To the valley of darkness.
c295_story1	One. I swear to be your faithful companion as long as I live, Bathory.\I will always serve you.\Nothing will cause me to leave your side.
c295_story2	Let us return.\For though we walk through the valley of darkness we fear not calamity.
c295_story3	Almighty god, bestow upon us your mercy,\forgive our sins,\and lead us to eternal life.
c295_true1	My name is... My name is Theresa.\No, wait, Unknown?\No, I...
c295_true2	I've lost...my eternal companion.\Where?\Where am I?
c295_true3	Sayoko...let's meet again...someday.\Don't worry. We'll meet again, for sure.
c295_victory	*sigh* Is this a dream?
c296_boss_long	Battling is so exciting!
c296_boss_short	Welcome, dear customer!
c296_ctskill	Are you tired?
c296_death_1	Teehee...\You'll still love me even if I lose, right?
c296_death_2	Aaah!
c296_drive	Don't you run away!
c296_hit_1	Aaah!
c296_hit_2	Ow...
c296_hit_3	Oops.
c296_prskill	I'm just getting started.
c296_skill	Aha!
c296_spa	Eee! ♥\I just imagined you taking a bath,\little customer!
c296_startbt	Oh, boy! It's battle time!
c296_story1	You're just saying that\because I'm annoying, right?\Even I know that much.
c296_story2	If you don't reciprocate my feelings, little customer...\I'm gonna mess you up something fierce!
c296_story3	This cake is just for my dear little customer. Don't you even THINK of having so much as a taste, Ms. Succubus.
c296_true1	Hello, little customer! I'm so happy to see you.\I'm going to protect you until the day I die, you know!
c296_true2	You're everything to me, little customer. And I'm everything to you too, right? If I'm not...I'm going to be so sad. I might even cry!
c296_true3	I want nothing more than to be alone with you, little customer, but we keep getting interrupted. That makes me angry, and I can be pretty scary when I'm angry. Teehee!
c296_victory	You'll call me next time too, won't you?
c299_boss_long	Christmas is the perfect day for demons!
c299_boss_short	Have a holy night!
c299_ctskill	Happy holidays!
c299_death_1	Don't talk to me. I'm playing dead.
c299_death_2	I didn't want this kind of present...
c299_drive	Want to see a miracle?
c299_hit_1	Guh!
c299_hit_2	Dammit!
c299_hit_3	I messed up...
c299_prskill	Time to deliver presents!
c299_skill	Hahaha!
c299_spa	You still take a bath with your mother?\Outrageous!
c299_startbt	If you're naughty,\Santa's gonna be upset!
c299_story1	Haha, this is why I love kids.\Now, how should I tease her next...
c299_story2	Who decided that Santa could only ever wear red?\You should keep a more open mind.
c299_story3	I'm afraid I can't.\This place is far too small for my grandiose plans...
c299_true1	You're a demon, right? If you really are that dense, then go beg someone else for help.\*sigh* I guess I have to start at the beginning...
c299_true2	You say you're not cut out for the Archfiend Contest?\So what? As a demon, you'll need to deal with it sooner or later.
c299_true3	Let's go on a trip. Leaving the nest is an important experience for any baby bird.\Once you've seen more of the world, even you should find yourself changed in some way.
c299_victory	Glad to see you come through when it counts, kid.
c300_boss_long	I shall face you and hold nothing back!
c300_boss_short	Prepare yourself.
c300_ctskill	How unfortunate for you.
c300_death_1	Well done...
c300_death_2	Ngh...
c300_drive	This ends now!
c300_hit_1	What?!
c300_hit_2	Aaah!
c300_hit_3	Eek!
c300_prskill	Obstacles will be eliminated!
c300_skill	Stand back!
c300_spa	Master...\This is my own private rest area.
c300_startbt	Let me show you what I can do!
c300_story1	You are an Archfiend candidate, right, Master?\In other words, you aren't yet the Archfiend.
c300_story2	If I were to help you win the Archfiend Contest,\I would be renowned forever as the problem-solver who turned the weakest demon ever into the Archfiend.
c300_story3	Well done, master.\You are now one step closer to the throne.
c300_true1	So you're my new client.\I'll consider this my last chance, and do everything in my power to help you.
c300_true2	Are you ready to acknowledge me yet?
c300_true3	I can see your potential with my own eyes, Master. Believe me, if I didn't think you could win, I wouldn't be here.\Will you trust in me until the very end?
c300_victory	That takes care of that!
c301_boss_long	Let's hurry up and end this!
c301_boss_short	Who're you?
c301_ctskill	Outta my way!
c301_death_1	Laugh it up while you can...
c301_death_2	Ugh...
c301_drive	Watch out for this!
c301_hit_1	Ugh...
c301_hit_2	Oh?
c301_hit_3	Wah!
c301_prskill	Get a grip!
c301_skill	Don't get cocky!
c301_spa	Oh man, this is good stuff!\Why didn't you tell me about this place sooner?!
c301_startbt	I knew it. You need me, don't ya!
c301_story1	Well, just you wait.\First I'm gonna get my hands on the Hades Flower, then I'm gonna get back my freedom!
c301_story2	There's two kinds of demons in this world.\Run-of-the mill demons and human-like ones.
c301_story3	Sorry? I'm glad to be rid of him!\I worked myself to the bone for that lousy demon. If I never see him again, it'll be too soon.
c301_true1	I'll make good use of the Hades Flower, so hurry up and give it to me.\A half-baked demon like you doesn't need it anyway.
c301_true2	You trying to act like my master?\A half-baked demon like you?\If you wanna be my master, you gotta set a good example!
c301_true3	Don't go thinking I'll be sticking around this dump forever, boss!\I'll be getting out of here one of these days, so you better make use of me while you still can.
c301_victory	I got this covered!
c305_89_boss_long	I'll baptize you.
c305_89_boss_short	Baptism time.
c305_89_bubble_prskill	For the salvation of souls...
c305_89_bubble_skill	Oremus.
c305_89_ctskill	Wail!
c305_89_death_1	The prayers...of this weak soul...
c305_89_death_2	Ugh...
c305_89_drive	Miserere nobis!
c305_89_hit_1	Yes.
c305_89_hit_2	Gah...
c305_89_hit_3	Right...
c305_89_hit_4	Hehehe...
c305_89_hit_5	You'll be saved.
c305_89_hit_6	You dare mock the Lord?
c305_89_hit_7	Amen.
c305_89_hit_8	(Hissing)
c305_89_hit_9	(Hissing)
c305_89_prskill	Lost lambs!
c305_89_skill	Let us pray.
c305_boss_long	Now, kneel before your Lord.
c305_boss_short	Pitiable souls...
c305_ctskill	Wail!
c305_death_1	The prayers...of this weak soul...
c305_death_2	Ugh...
c305_drive	Lord, have mercy on us!
c305_hit_1	Ngh!
c305_hit_2	Hah!
c305_hit_3	Agh!
c305_prskill	Lost lambs!
c305_skill	Let us pray.
c305_spa	*sigh* This feels so good.\Truly this is the blessing of god.
c305_startbt	Honor the Lord!
c305_story1	They say I was born of a demon,\but in essence I was born of human greed.
c305_story2	I had an odd dream.\I just cannot fathom what that person wants.
c305_story3	Go to souls who long for death, anoint their heads with water, and give them new names.
c305_true1	What am I thinking? I was born of a demon. No matter what I wish, my existence stems from demonic magic.
c305_true2	The world is filthy and cruel. It is a prison for souls. Those poor unfortunate souls... Can you save them?
c305_true3	My demon, I'll create a world for you. My name is Rita. I'm a Child born of a demon's compassion.
c305_victory	Lord, I thank you for this victory.
c308_10_boss_long	The little baby chicks are here.\Hahaha!
c308_10_boss_short	Whoever wants to die, come get it!
c308_10_ctskill	I'm havin' a blast!
c308_10_death_1	I won't forget you... I won't.
c308_10_death_2	I'll be back... You better believe it.
c308_10_drive	I'm going full throttle!
c308_10_hit_1	Hmph!
c308_10_hit_2	That all ya got?
c308_10_hit_3	Ooh, that one hurt.
c308_10_prskill	Let it rip!
c308_10_skill	What a treat!
c308_10_spa	The water's just right.
c308_10_startbt	All ya lazy idiots, follow me!
c308_10_story1	Hee hee hee.\Ever the comedian, I see.\No—my beef is with the Infernal Realm.
c308_10_story2	We'll play along, to a degree, and stay alive.\Revenge will follow.
c308_10_story3	It doesn't matter if you make the wrong or right decisions;\letting someone else decide FOR you is taking something really important\and flushing it down the can.
c308_10_true1	They said they were getting together demons in their prime.\All I see is a bunch o' brats who are wet behind the ears.
c308_10_true2	You look like you've got time to spare, kid.\I'm a busy demon so you go on and play with Babel.
c308_10_true3	The realm's most underhanded demon, was I?\I did spend a while sitting on my hands!
c308_10_victory	The obvious outcome!
c308_boss_long	The little baby chicks are here.\Hahaha!
c308_boss_short	Whoever wants to die, come get it!
c308_ctskill	I'm havin' a blast!
c308_death_1	I won't forget you... I won't.
c308_death_2	I'll be back... You better believe it.
c308_drive	I'm going full throttle!
c308_hit_1	Hmph!
c308_hit_2	That all ya got?
c308_hit_3	Ooh, that one hurt.
c308_prskill	Let it rip!
c308_skill	What a treat!
c308_spa	The water's just right.
c308_startbt	All ya lazy idiots, follow me!
c308_story1	Hee hee hee.\Ever the comedian, I see.\No—my beef is with the Infernal Realm.
c308_story2	We'll play along, to a degree, and stay alive.\Revenge will follow.
c308_story3	It doesn't matter if you make the wrong or right decisions;\letting someone else decide FOR you is taking something really important\and flushing it down the can.

c308_true2	You look like you've got time to spare, kid.\I'm a busy demon so you go on and play with Babel.
c308_true3	The realm's most underhanded demon, was I?\I did spend a while sitting on my hands!
c308_victory	The obvious outcome!
c310_boss_long	Am I "It" today?
c310_boss_short	Ready or not, here I come!
c310_ctskill	Pain, Pain Go Away!
c310_death_1	I just wanted to be friends...
c310_death_2	Waaah!
c310_drive	Let's Have Lotsa Fun!
c310_hit_1	Wha-?
c310_hit_2	Urk...
c310_hit_3	I don't like ouchies!
c310_prskill	Flower Go Bloom!
c310_skill	I'll Help!
c310_spa	I'm on a trip to a spring that's hot! Wowzers!\This water's so warm! ♪
c310_startbt	Let's all do our best.
c310_story1	Get more friends than any other demon and then\be a good Archfiend that doesn't bully people!
c310_story2	Well, I looove rainy days. ♪\Did you know? Frogs croak on rainy days.
c310_story3	When it pours like that, the next day, flowers bloom.\That day after a rainy day, that tomorrow,\I look forward to it so much.
c310_true1	I made so many new friends.\Like Mona, Davi, and Lisa!
c310_true2	Hm?\Why are you so worried?\You just wanna see my smiley face, don't you?
c310_true3	You're nice, Mr. Demon, so if you became the Archfiend, everyone would get along, right?\That's why I'm gonna help you!
c310_victory	I did my very best!
c311_10_boss_long	The water is cool.\Come here and forever rest with me.
c311_10_boss_short	I shall give you eternal rest.
c311_10_ctskill	Die.
c311_10_death_1	Uck... Can't believe this...
c311_10_death_2	It won't be so bad to rest...
c311_10_drive	Don't interrupt my rest!
c311_10_hit_1	Uck.
c311_10_hit_2	Better than I thought.
c311_10_hit_3	It's nothing.
c311_10_prskill	Take this!
c311_10_skill	It's cool.
c311_10_spa	You should take it off and come in too.
c311_10_startbt	Won't forgive anyone who disturbs my rest.
c311_10_story1	Come on, get right here to...
c311_10_story2	You are... rather daring.
c311_10_story3	Should you feel stronger than me anytime,\you may challenge me.
c311_10_true1	Guess I will have to take you down with me
c311_10_true2	I didn't plan to make friends, family, and disciples.\I was determined to live by myself
c311_10_true3	I guess it's cute... to make a Child who's just like my disciple\Everything the Master said was correct.
c311_10_victory	So easy that I can beat you while I am resting!
c311_89_boss_long	I'll obliterate every last trace of you!
c311_89_boss_short	Death to the weak.
c311_89_bubble_prskill	Wail in torment!
c311_89_bubble_skill	You'll all soon be dead!
c311_89_ctskill	It's over.
c311_89_death_1	I have lost.
c311_89_death_2	Gwah...
c311_89_drive	Come, my fragments.
c311_89_hit_1	Impressive.
c311_89_hit_2	Heheheh.
c311_89_hit_3	Ooof!
c311_89_hit_4	A fine strike.
c311_89_hit_5	Uh...
c311_89_hit_6	Is that all?
c311_89_hit_7	Now it's my turn.
c311_89_hit_8	Gah...
c311_89_hit_9	Keep working on it...
c311_89_prskill	Die.
c311_89_skill	Behold.
c311_boss_long	I'll obliterate every last trace of you!
c311_boss_short	Death to the weak.
c311_ctskill	It's over.
c311_death_1	I have lost.
c311_death_2	So this is the end...
c311_drive	Come, my fragments.
c311_hit_1	Good!
c311_hit_2	Heheheh.
c311_hit_3	Urgh!
c311_prskill	Die.
c311_skill	Behold.
c311_spa	I see I can't let my guard down around you.
c311_startbt	Witness the gulf that divides us!
c311_story1	You are far too vulnerable—almost as defenseless as a child. You would do well to pay more attention to your surroundings.
c311_story2	Demons with many weaknesses are usually the first to be weeded out.\So how are you still alive?
c311_story3	I shall kill them all.\I shall cut them into pieces, and swallow them, until not a single one remains.
c311_true1	I was once known as "Nameless."
c311_true2	I stole my master's name and seized my own existence.\But you... You seem unable to commit to anything.
c311_true3	In order to prove that I am right, I must become stronger than anyone else.
c311_victory	Today, I have proven my strength once again.
c312_boss_long	Another dull customer?
c312_boss_short	I'm so happy!
c312_ctskill	Behave yourself.
c312_death_1	I'll get you...for this...
c312_death_2	Waaah!
c312_drive	Let me cut you!
c312_hit_1	Yikes!
c312_hit_2	...
c312_hit_3	Urgh!
c312_prskill	Your blood is just what my knife needs!
c312_skill	You're so weak.
c312_spa	Teatime? Don't mind if I do.
c312_startbt	Shall I help you, master?
c312_story1	Sweets are pointless if they're left uneaten.\And that goes doubly for sweet cakes.
c312_story2	Who cares how cute a cake is? There's no point if you can't eat it.\And you can't eat cake without inserting a knife...
c312_story3	Knives were originally created to divide one thing into two things.\Much like the way you cut up a cake into pieces...
c312_true1	Say, Master, is that thing sticking up from your head a horn, or your hair?\I bet I could find out if I cut it off... Hehehe.
c312_true2	Why do I only use knives? Because they're the most beautiful tool in all of creation.\Although maybe that's a little much for you to wrap your head around...
c312_true3	I made a delicious cake just for you, Master.\This should get you to finally shut up...\Oops, did I say that out loud? Teehee.
c312_victory	Aww, my knife got dirty.
c315_89_boss_long	Do I really need to step in?
c315_89_boss_short	Weaklings.
c315_89_bubble_prskill	Don't you want to live?
c315_89_bubble_skill	So foolish.
c315_89_ctskill	It's showtime!
c315_89_death_1	"Methuselah...does not die..."
c315_89_death_2	Bah...
c315_89_drive	Struggle for me.
c315_89_hit_1	Hm...
c315_89_hit_2	Hah hah...
c315_89_hit_3	Is that all?
c315_89_hit_4	How troublesome.
c315_89_hit_5	Ugh...
c315_89_hit_6	*sigh*
c315_89_hit_7	So ugly.
c315_89_hit_8	Out of the way!
c315_89_hit_9	Silence!
c315_89_prskill	Don't you want to live?
c315_89_skill	So foolish.
c315_boss_long	The Rebirth Lab\welcomes you!
c315_boss_short	How can I help you?
c315_ctskill	It's showtime!
c315_death_1	Methuselah...does not die...\*hack*!
c315_death_2	This can't be!\I could never–!
c315_drive	Now,\let us be reborn!
c315_hit_1	Damn!
c315_hit_2	Urgh!
c315_hit_3	Gwah!
c315_prskill	How do you find it?\This beauty.
c315_skill	Welcome!
c315_spa	Hee hee.\Aren't you glad? You get to soak in the baths with me.
c315_startbt	Thank you for your visit!
c315_story1	Wodan is of the mind to make this month "gambling free,"\and so it shall be.
c315_story2	I will commit you to memory for all time.\I will make it so your name never fades.
c315_story3	It's just you and me,\Wodan.\Only we can understand each other.
c315_true1	My name is Methuselah.\Yeah, I've a couple years under my belt.\Hahahahahahaha!\Ahh, Wodan and I go back about 200 years.
c315_true2	If you get to become Archfiend,\that means I'll move up in the world, too, right?\Hahaha, I'm kidding.\Just kidding...
c315_true3	I don't want to throw my life away\on fruitless endeavors like the Archfiend Contest.\I've something far more pressing at hand.
c315_victory	Seems battle wasn't really your thing.
c316_boss_long	Welcome!\Sorry for the wait!
c316_boss_short	How do you want to look?
c316_ctskill	Yah!
c316_death_1	My final...moments?\No, that can't...be right....
c316_death_2	Agh...urk...
c316_drive	You look absolutely dreadful.\This will require emergency treatment.
c316_hit_1	Ow!
c316_hit_2	Ugh...
c316_hit_3	Hey, what are you--?!
c316_prskill	This should work!
c316_skill	So annoying!
c316_spa	Hrm...\I can't really make out the writing here...
c316_startbt	Wodan has arrived!\Everyone outta the way!
c316_story1	My service fees are sky high. We're talking crazy expensive here.\Did you really think what you brought would be enough?\Or did you plan to sell some organs to make up the difference?
c316_story2	We here at the Rebirth Lab will work together with you\to help you gain true beauty, for a price.
c316_story3	Even if you're born ugly,\you can never get rid of the desire to be beautiful!\By changing appearances,\demons should be able to go even further!
c316_true1	Demon and human souls are a little different.\Souls don't make the most dependable vessels.
c316_true2	You wanna be beautiful, too?\Then will you take part in a little clinical trial?
c316_true3	Ultimately, demons are worth no more than humans.\For all our fortitude and permanence, we're still cowards.
c316_victory	I'm really just not built for battle.
c317_boss_long	I am Father Babila.\Which, by the way, is an alias.
c317_boss_short	So you've come.
c317_ctskill	May the blessing of God be upon you.
c317_death_1	Bless you...
c317_death_2	May the blessing of God be upon you.
c317_drive	This is the result of my research!
c317_hit_1	Gah!
c317_hit_2	Heh...
c317_hit_3	How dare you.
c317_prskill	Be blessed!
c317_skill	Oh dear...
c317_spa	I honestly don't understand.\The way you conduct yourself is just...*sigh*
c317_startbt	It was not my original purpose, but I shall help.
c317_story1	I will swear an oath of devotion to you.\Please allow me accompany you.
c317_story2	Haha. Such a futile struggle.\It's quite adorable.
c317_story3	I'm being mean?\Haha, I apologize if there has been some misunderstanding.
c317_true1	The Saint Michael's School for Girls was fun, but,\I shouldn't have overdone it.
c317_true2	Can I be honest with you?\I despise you.\I'm only tagging along on Kubaba's orders.
c317_true3	Kubaba aims to overthrow the Infernal Realm.\Her sights are set even beyond the Archfiend.\I'm simply serving that ambition.
c317_victory	I collected some good data.
c318_10_boss_long	I shall put an end to you myself.
c318_10_boss_short	Right this way.
c318_10_ctskill	So, you aren't trying to escape.
c318_10_death_1	To think my own death would come so quickly...
c318_10_death_2	It's as though it were all but a frail dream...
c318_10_drive	Enjoy your new life in paradise.
c318_10_hit_1	Be grateful.
c318_10_hit_2	Aaah!
c318_10_hit_3	Eee!
c318_10_hit_4	Phew...
c318_10_hit_5	Nrmm...
c318_10_hit_6	No way...
c318_10_hit_7	How could you...
c318_10_hit_8	Oof!
c318_10_hit_9	Huh?
c318_10_prskill	Let me guide you to the land of the dead.
c318_10_skill	Pitiful.
c318_10_spa	Ahhh... This is paradise...
c318_10_startbt	Can you hear the call of the dead?
c318_10_story1	As a mere Child, I cannot even imagine what such a world must be like...
c318_10_story2	Spirits wander around regardless of the time of day.\If you don't watch what you say, it could lead to disaster.
c318_10_story3	My dream is but to soothe the souls of the poor, forlorn dead...
c318_10_true1	I may not be of much use, but if I can help the dead rest in peace...then please, use me as you see fit.
c318_10_true2	Though demons may live much longer than humans, they too will die one day.\When they do, I will guide them to the afterlife as well.
c318_10_true3	One can attain everything, and still not conquer death. But if you could rule the realm of the dead...then it may be possible to change even that.
c318_10_victory	Well done.
c318_11_boss_long	I shall put an end to you myself.
c318_11_boss_short	Right this way.
c318_11_ctskill	So, you aren't trying to escape.
c318_11_death_1	To think my own death would come so quickly...
c318_11_death_2	It's as though it were all but a frail dream...
c318_11_drive	Enjoy your new life in paradise.
c318_11_hit_1	Be grateful.
c318_11_hit_2	Aaah!
c318_11_hit_3	Eee!
c318_11_hit_4	Phew...
c318_11_hit_5	Nrmm...
c318_11_hit_6	No way...
c318_11_hit_7	How could you...
c318_11_hit_8	Oof!
c318_11_hit_9	Huh?
c318_11_prskill	Let me guide you to the land of the dead.
c318_11_skill	Pitiful.
c318_11_spa	Ahhh... This is paradise...
c318_11_startbt	Can you hear the call of the dead?
c318_11_story1	As a mere Child, I cannot even imagine what such a world must be like...
c318_11_story2	Spirits wander around regardless of the time of day.\If you don't watch what you say, it could lead to disaster.
c318_11_story3	My dream is but to soothe the souls of the poor, forlorn dead...
c318_11_true1	I may not be of much use, but if I can help the dead rest in peace...then please, use me as you see fit.
c318_11_true2	Though demons may live much longer than humans, they too will die one day.\When they do, I will guide them to the afterlife as well.
c318_11_true3	One can attain everything, and still not conquer death. But if you could rule the realm of the dead...then it may be possible to change even that.
c318_11_victory	Well done.
c318_89_boss_long	I shall put an end to you myself.
c318_89_boss_short	Right this way.
c318_89_bubble_prskill	Let me guide you to the land of the dead.
c318_89_bubble_skill	Pitiful.
c318_89_ctskill	So, you aren't trying to escape.
c318_89_death_1	To think my own death would come so quickly...
c318_89_death_2	It's as though it were all but a frail dream...
c318_89_drive	Enjoy your new life in paradise.
c318_89_hit_1	Be grateful.
c318_89_hit_2	Aaah!
c318_89_hit_3	Eee!
c318_89_hit_4	Phew...
c318_89_hit_5	Nrmm...
c318_89_hit_6	No way...
c318_89_hit_7	How could you...
c318_89_hit_8	Oof!
c318_89_hit_9	Huh?
c318_89_prskill	Let me guide you to the land of the dead.
c318_89_skill	Pitiful.
c318_boss_long	Forlorn soul, I shall guide you to the afterlife, so that you may rest in peace.
c318_boss_short	I shall send you to the realm of the dead.
c318_ctskill	Let me guide you.
c318_death_1	So this is how death finds me...
c318_death_2	It seems it is now my turn to pass on...
c318_drive	May your journey beyond be swift and sure.
c318_hit_1	Ah!
c318_hit_2	Ugh...
c318_hit_3	So this is pain...
c318_prskill	I hope to see you again in the afterlife.
c318_skill	Return to where you belong...
c318_spa	Ahhh... This is paradise...
c318_startbt	Can you hear the call of the dead?
c318_story1	As a mere Child, I cannot even imagine what such a world must be like...
c318_story2	Spirits wander around regardless of the time of day.\If you don't watch what you say, it could lead to disaster.
c318_story3	My dream is but to soothe the souls of the poor, forlorn dead...
c318_true1	I may not be of much use, but if I can help the dead rest in peace...then please, use me as you see fit.
c318_true2	Though demons may live much longer than humans, they too will die one day.\When they do, I will guide them to the afterlife as well.
c318_true3	One can attain everything, and still not conquer death. But if you could rule the realm of the dead...then it may be possible to change even that.
c318_victory	Well done.
c319_boss_long	My name is Willow Doryeong.\I am a demon, just like you.
c319_boss_short	Will you hear me out?
c319_ctskill	I'm afraid I have taken too much of your time.
c319_death_1	Take good care of the Hades Flower.
c319_death_2	Miraculous power always leads to its misuse.
c319_drive	I believe in you!
c319_hit_1	Ah!
c319_hit_2	Ugh...
c319_hit_3	...
c319_prskill	Demons cannot be trusted.
c319_skill	Forgive me for this insolence!
c319_spa	What are you doing here?
c319_startbt	Rest assured...I will not be taking part in the Archfiend Contest.
c319_story1	Correct. It is known as the Hades Flower.
c319_story2	Demons and humans alike know of this flower, and are trying to obtain it for themselves.
c319_story3	Yes... I am certain I can place my trust in you.\After all, you hesitated to lie to me.
c319_true1	Since ancient times, demons have had no compunctions about stealing or killing in order to obtain what they want.
c319_true2	I am terribly sorry, but the Hades Flower is no longer here.\It seems you have wasted your time tracking me down.
c319_true3	Thus, I have protected this flower for a long time, in order to prevent that.
c319_victory	How wonderful!
c321_boss_long	Hello. It's me, your Luna.
c321_boss_short	Did I keep you waiting?
c321_ctskill	I have a gift for you.
c321_death_1	I wanted to be...by your side...a little longer...
c321_death_2	Good...bye...
c321_drive	Sparkle and shine!
c321_hit_1	Ow ow owww!
c321_hit_2	Eeek!
c321_hit_3	Phew...
c321_prskill	Show me you mean it!
c321_skill	How's this?
c321_spa	Come on in. You can sit right here next to me.
c321_startbt	Am I the leader today?
c321_story1	Reeeally, now?\Were you always so quick to lie? You're otherwise so bashful.
c321_story2	Hee hee. It's the first time you've done so. Did you know that?\I'm gonna have to do my best not to let you down!
c321_story3	Pretty weighty words there.\Well, at any rate, the pleasure is mine.\From now on, I'll do what I can to protect you\as your servant.
c321_true1	My pactmaker ended up having a breakdown because of the demons.\Isn't that awful? That's why I want to protect her.
c321_true2	Was I of any help? That would make me so happy!
c321_true3	It seems my pactmaker doesn't remember me, but I still wanna help her.\After all, she's me and I'm her.
c321_victory	What do you think?\Gimme some props!
c324_boss_long	It's my turn now!\Get ready!
c324_boss_short	Now then, let's get started!
c324_ctskill	How's this for you?
c324_death_1	I'm not running away,\this is just...a strategic retreat!
c324_death_2	Aaah!
c324_drive	Victory is as good as ours!
c324_hit_1	Eee!
c324_hit_2	Aaah!
c324_hit_3	Aaah!
c324_prskill	Don't you ignore me!
c324_skill	As you wish!
c324_spa	This place is so wonderful.
c324_startbt	Go do what you do best, Master!
c324_story1	Now then!\It's time I found myself a charming demon to be my master!
c324_story2	None of us asked to be born as aides,\yet they treat us like we're disposable nonetheless. Why?
c324_story3	I'm in no need of big, strong demons.\I'd rather one that is just useless without my help.\Someone who just, I don't know, makes you want to try and protect them.
c324_true1	Hello there, Master ♥\It's me, your aide, Mona, at your service!
c324_true2	All that remains where the Archfiend Contest ends are corpses and abandoned weapons.\Is that we're I'm bound for, someday...?
c324_true3	Don't you worry, Master!\You'll be the next Archfiend, I'll see to it!\It's the very thing I live for!
c324_victory	Told you we'd win, didn't I?
c329_boss_long	Here comes Davi!
c329_boss_short	Want to play hide-and-seek?
c329_ctskill	Go!
c329_death_1	No! I don't want to lose...
c329_death_2	Davi lost. Oh, well.
c329_drive	Got you!
c329_hit_1	Ouch!
c329_hit_2	Eeek!
c329_hit_3	That hurts!
c329_prskill	Davi's the best!
c329_skill	Let's go!
c329_spa	Whoa! My heart was racing when I was playing hide-and-seek.\But now, I'm all relaxed and cozy.
c329_startbt	Go!
c329_story1	Whee! Davi's the fastest in the world!
c329_story2	Hey, Master. Davi wants something.\Could you buy it for her?
c329_story3	Ah, Argos, are you it?\Davi wants to catch Zephyros, too!
c329_true1	Any demon want to play hide-and-seek with Davi?\Davi's going to be it first! Teehee!
c329_true2	Davi loves racing on the circuit.\It's as if the track speaks to her.
c329_true3	Davi loves playing hide-and-seek on the circuit.\She's going to race with Mona next time.
c329_victory	Whee! Davi won!
c332_boss_long	Hey there! I'm Ganesha! Great to meetcha!
c332_boss_short	Wahaha! The smell of money's in the air!
c332_ctskill	Smile now! Smile!
c332_death_1	Wohoho! No need to get all mad!
c332_death_2	Hmph...
c332_drive	High risk, high reward!
c332_hit_1	Ah-ha-ha!
c332_hit_2	Lighten up!
c332_hit_3	Meanie!
c332_prskill	Live a little!
c332_skill	I've got just what you need!
c332_spa	Ahhh, this is true bliss!
c332_startbt	All right, you can place your bets on me!
c332_story1	Light eating, self-control, and restraint. These are the things that make a real girl.\Bahaha! I bet you fell for it, didn't ya?\You won't find anyone with better acting chops than my holy self!
c332_story2	What are you so mad about?\I bet the head exorcists just have the wrong idea!\Nothing good is ever gonna come of anything this masochistic!
c332_story3	Pretty much every last exorcist is a masochist. Gives you the chills, right?\That's why they're no fun to hang around with.\Wahahaha!
c332_true1	Hey, settle down now, rooster-hair.\I'm not looking to pick a fight with you.\There'd be nothing in it for me, anyway.
c332_true2	Cha-CHING! Wahahaha!\Wanna know why I'm having so much fun?\Well, me too, to be honest!
c332_true3	I'm so glad I got to be an exorcist!\Wahahaha! The one who scouted me, though?\Looks like they're having a tough time.\But hey, anyone would have fallen for class acting like mine!
c332_victory	Another astonishing victory for Ganesha! Joy be to all!
c333_88_boss_long	How rude.
c333_88_boss_short	You guys are really ugly~
c333_88_bubble_prskill	Laudate dominium!
c333_88_bubble_skill	Don't be afraid!
c333_88_ctskill	Don't run away!
c333_88_death_1	This doesn't fit me~!
c333_88_death_2	Watch me!
c333_88_drive	Vade retro me satana!
c333_88_hit_1	Over my dead body!
c333_88_hit_2	I'll remember you!
c333_88_hit_3	Move it!
c333_88_hit_4	That ticks me off!
c333_88_hit_5	Oh, no, so scary.
c333_88_hit_6	Aaah!
c333_88_hit_7	Ahhh!
c333_88_hit_8	Not bad.
c333_88_hit_9	Ho ho~
c333_88_prskill	Laudate dominium!
c333_88_skill	Don't be afraid~ Heh heh!
c333_boss_long	Let's see how good you are!
c333_boss_short	Hmph. I don't need to see it.
c333_ctskill	Ugh, what a pain.
c333_death_1	This doesn't fit me~!
c333_death_2	Watch me!
c333_drive	Vade retro me, satana!
c333_hit_1	Watch it.
c333_hit_2	Ahhh!
c333_hit_3	Ugh!
c333_prskill	Tachete!
c333_skill	What a mess.
c333_spa	Hmm... Not bad. You don't believe me?\I'm not being sarcastic. I'm being genuine this time.
c333_startbt	Just don't slow me down.
c333_story1	Stop trying to change the topic.\It's not like I'm trying to prolong my time with you.
c333_story2	If I keep my head, I can free\myself from this lion's den.
c333_story3	*sigh* That makes me feel better. I miss my teacher\and his wisdom so much. Jonah, however...
c333_true1	I'm Deborah. It is the greatest and noblest of names.\So please don't utter it so flippantly.
c333_true2	One is born with the talent.\Well, I guess hard work is also important. Tee hee.
c333_true3	My Teacher said hard work is the most important thing.\I don't understand what he means, but I will follow his teachings.
c333_victory	I've taken a liking to you.
c334_boss_long	This is the perfect place to fight in.
c334_boss_short	Welcome.
c334_ctskill	How can I help you?
c334_death_1	I wasn't expecting this...
c334_death_2	Ugh. That was a mistake.
c334_drive	You underestimated me.
c334_hit_1	Ngh!
c334_hit_2	This is not good.
c334_hit_3	Please, get out of the way.
c334_prskill	I'll take care of you myself.
c334_skill	Would you step aside, please?
c334_spa	I don't mind spending some time relaxing,\just not too much.
c334_startbt	Let me help.
c334_story1	Oh, no. Now I know what it's like to be a mouse with a cat hot on its heels.\It is not pleasant.
c334_story2	I can't trust him, but I have no choice.\He's the only lead I have.
c334_story3	Why am I so frustrated right now?\It feels like I'm missing something important.
c334_true1	Following you has gotten me this far, Master.\But I don't blame you. This is also part of my duties.
c334_true2	Are you sure you can do this alone?\Bravado will only hurt you.
c334_true3	There's nothing I can't do.\But even I need help.
c334_victory	That was a tough fight.
c335_10_boss_long	Want to work out together?
c335_10_boss_short	Let's see if you can handle this.
c335_10_ctskill	Haaah!
c335_10_death_1	*sniffle*...
c335_10_death_2	Did I need more mental training?
c335_10_drive	Sometimes you have to endure!
c335_10_hit_1	Ha!
c335_10_hit_2	Heh heh...
c335_10_hit_3	Hahaha!
c335_10_prskill	How weak.
c335_10_skill	What a steamy night.
c335_10_spa	A nice hot spring after working out is the best.
c335_10_startbt	What do you say to hitting the hot springs afterwards?
c335_10_story1	I hadn't gotten serious in a really long time.
c335_10_story2	The Minotaur is my ancestor.\His blood runs through my veins. That makes me a demigod.
c335_10_story3	The fate of the twelve apostles will play out just as the prophet spoke.\It's yet another example of the fates of time.
c335_10_true1	I'm impressed.\Not just anyone can survive one of my attacks.
c335_10_true2	I'm glad I've met someone who can fight at my level.
c335_10_true3	Maybe that could be my paradise.
c335_10_victory	Looks like I won again.
c335_boss_long	If you're still alive, do some strength training.
c335_boss_short	Tell me the big three's totals.
c335_ctskill	Do it like you mean it!
c335_death_1	I'm going to lose muscle mass...
c335_death_2	I should've trained harder...
c335_drive	Check out my strength.
c335_hit_1	Hm!
c335_hit_2	That tickled.
c335_hit_3	Yes, that's it.
c335_prskill	Endure!
c335_skill	Want to see what it's like when I give it my all?
c335_spa	A nice hot spring after working out is the best.
c335_startbt	I'm ending this quick so I can go work out.
c335_story1	I hadn't gotten serious in a really long time.
c335_story2	The Minotaur is my ancestor.\His blood runs through my veins. That makes me a demigod.
c335_story3	The fate of the twelve apostles will play out just as the prophet spoke.\It's yet another example of the fates of time.
c335_true1	I'm impressed.\Not just anyone can survive one of my attacks.
c335_true2	I'm glad I've met someone who can fight at my level.
c335_true3	Maybe that could be my paradise.
c335_victory	Maybe a major meat party is in order.
c336_boss_long	So we came all this way.
c336_boss_short	Tch, stay out of the way.
c336_ctskill	Why don't you give up?
c336_death_1	Don't even think this is it.
c336_death_2	Guh...!
c336_drive	Let's end this fight.
c336_hit_1	Aaah!
c336_hit_2	Aaah!
c336_hit_3	Urgh!
c336_prskill	I'm not weak!
c336_skill	Leave it to me.
c336_spa	Oh no,\I'm gonna fall asleep like this...
c336_startbt	I'll be right by your side.
c336_story1	I am truly grateful for our encounter,\Demon.
c336_story2	So you thought I might be lonely?\Care to join me for a walk, then?\I, uh, won't force you, but...
c336_story3	Violence only begets more violence.\I won't let you disrupt the peace we have.
c336_true1	Hello, Master.\Are you the one who gave me a new name?
c336_true2	Loneliness isn't a sad thing.\What IS sad is becoming numb to loneliness\and sulking in your sorrows.
c336_true3	Your fate is my fate.\Even if despair awaits us, I will not abandon you.
c336_victory	I hope for the fighting to stop..
c337_boss_long	I'll race you!
c337_boss_short	Let's play!
c337_ctskill	Prepurr yourself!
c337_death_1	I'm tired...
c337_death_2	Meouch, that hurt...
c337_drive	Go fur it!
c337_hit_1	Mew?!
c337_hit_2	Mew meow?!
c337_hit_3	*sniff*...
c337_prskill	Running as fast as I can!
c337_skill	You can do it!
c337_spa	Mew meow!\A dip in the hot spring after lotsa running is the best!
c337_startbt	Passing the baton!
c337_story1	I'll protect you, Runt!
c337_story2	I'm really good at sprinting!
c337_story3	I'm gonna try really hard to find everyone!
c337_true1	Runt, I don't know what I'd do if I lost you, too.
c337_true2	I'd get bullied fur sure if I got caught by an exorcist!
c337_true3	I wanna have fun playing with everyone again!
c337_victory	I came in first!
c338_boss_long	I've been waiting for you!
c338_boss_short	Were you looking for me?
c338_ctskill	You've gotta have courage! You've gotta believe!
c338_death_1	I guess it wasn't...meant to be...
c338_death_2	I'm gonna go ahead...and rest...
c338_drive	Let's get married!
c338_hit_1	Are you angry?
c338_hit_2	So mean...
c338_hit_3	Ngh!
c338_prskill	Let's be happy!
c338_skill	Leave it to me.
c338_spa	Are you fussing over me?\Well, thanks to you, I did get through another day\without any problems.
c338_startbt	I'll do my best!
c338_story1	I think if you talked to the person who looks like me calmly and slowly—\like you did to me—I'm sure she'd understand how you feel.\You know, deep in your heart.
c338_story2	Actually, looking back,\a lot really did happen.\I had to dig deep for courage...\But some fun things happened, too.
c338_story3	I... I don't actually hate you.\That much I can say for sure.
c338_true1	That really was my first time in a dispute.\Thinking back on it, it was kinda fun.\Though, I don't think I ever wanna go through that again.
c338_true2	Calchas said I changed a lot.\Do you think so, too, Master?\To be honest, I think I did, too.
c338_true3	Maybe not as much as Hildr,\but I learned how to be a little more courageous.\I hope tomorrow has something new for me to discover.
c338_victory	Thanks for your help.
c339_boss_long	I'll show you what the real Davi looks like.
c339_boss_short	Hello... My name is Davi.
c339_ctskill	I won't hide anymore.
c339_death_1	Don't abandon me.
c339_death_2	Bye-bye...Mona...
c339_drive	Let's go home together.
c339_hit_1	You forced my hand.
c339_hit_2	Why?!
c339_hit_3	Ooof!
c339_prskill	What do I do to forget?!
c339_skill	I'm right here.
c339_spa	Mona,\aren't you tired of dealing with that stupid demon already?\You should come and relax with me!
c339_startbt	I'm not the Davi I once was.
c339_story1	I wonder why.\I'm sad. She's detestable.\She's lovely.\Wasn't I supposed to hate her?
c339_story2	That's not true.\I do have a mommy! She's...\She's really nice and she tells me I'm cute all the time.\And she always says we'll be together...
c339_story3	No, it's okay. I finally understand.\You felt my heart and I was able to feel yours.\My wish is for you to be happy because, Davi, you're me.\And I'm you.
c339_true1	It's dark...\Completely dark. I can't see a thing.\I'm in a darkness I can't escape.
c339_true2	Davi is in me, and I am in Davi.\We are two, yet once again, we become one.
c339_true3	Mona, my hatred for you was ever growing.\But now I understand.\My hate was driven by my love for you.\
c339_victory	I'm okay now, Mona.
c342_boss_long	Naughty children get punished, you know.
c342_boss_short	Ehehehehe...
c342_ctskill	Ehehe. Does it hurt?
c342_death_1	Know... your place!
c342_death_2	Ah hahaha!
c342_drive	Time for your private lesson.
c342_hit_1	Oh, I see.
c342_hit_2	Behave.
c342_hit_3	Don't get too excited.
c342_prskill	Why don't you calm down a little?
c342_skill	Let's see. Who should I start with?
c342_spa	*sigh* I'm so bored. Hey, pipsqueak.\Want to do something more fun?
c342_startbt	Could you move, please?
c342_story1	Ehehe... What a naughty thing you are.\I said, answer yes or no, did I not?
c342_story2	Are you truly an Archfiend candidate?\No lie?
c342_story3	Well... You're an awfully brazen little girl.\Hmm, what ever shall we do with you?
c342_true1	The audacity you have\to call for me... Ehehe.
c342_true2	You don't learn, do you?\You need about 100 more years before you can try me.\Just stay nice and quiet until I address you.
c342_true3	Do not try to assert yourself.\You're to look no higher than where I step.
c342_victory	You seem to be in dire need of some education.
c343_boss_long	I will swallow your desires whole.
c343_boss_short	You look like a tasty morsel.
c343_ctskill	Could you get away, I wonder.
c343_death_1	Heh heh...
c343_death_2	Let's meet...again sometime...
c343_drive	Have you ever witnessed the serpent's dance?
c343_hit_1	You've got some fight in you.
c343_hit_2	Utterly irritating.
c343_hit_3	Oof!
c343_prskill	Kneel!
c343_skill	How's this?
c343_spa	Do you think this place suits me, short stuff? Hah.
c343_startbt	So much prey to choose from.
c343_story1	My name is Tiamat.\I'm pleased to have met you,\the source of the greed that gave me form.
c343_story2	I shouldn't be surprised your greed was so great\that even a demon couldn't imagine it.\Like a serpent's jaw unhinging\to swallow prey larger than itself.
c343_story3	Nothing in particular.\I just felt bad for you.\You were born from the true heart of humanity,\and yet you insist on continuing to wear a human shell.
c343_true1	The good go under my right foot and the evil under my left.\Now, with which foot should I step on you?
c343_true2	Not just anyone can sit on the Archfiend's throne.\But if you want to try it, go ahead.\I'll watch.\It could be fun, don't you think?
c343_true3	Do you like my new form?\It's not too bad, if I do say so myself.\Heh... Given your bashful expression\it's not bad at all.
c343_victory	I've taken a liking to you.
c344_10_boss_long	Hard work'll definitely betray you! Oops! I got it wrong!
c344_10_boss_short	I, Isolde, will take you on!
c344_10_ctskill	Gooo!
c344_10_death_1	This is a bad ending...I never even dreamed of.
c344_10_death_2	I'm so sorry...
c344_10_drive	Service Ace!
c344_10_hit_1	Aaah!
c344_10_hit_2	Awww! A miss!
c344_10_hit_3	Yikes!
c344_10_prskill	It's in my court now!
c344_10_skill	Take this, please!
c344_10_spa	E-Each Child has their own way of relaxing. That's all! I'm not playing around!
c344_10_startbt	I'm the leader? I'll do my absolute best!
c344_10_story1	1% courage, 99% concentrated power of will! It's me, Isolde, the star of Summer Scandal ♥
c344_10_story2	My master's lacking something and my teammates are flunkies! It's up to me to bear the responsibility for my master and my team!
c344_10_story3	I put forth just enough effort so that everything goes smoothly without any worries. 1% courage, 99% concentrated power of will! That's what I'm all about!
c344_10_true1	You saw someone who looked like me? A retired pop star? Oh... I think I have heard of that.
c344_10_true2	Today I'm going to get Tristan to answer me for sure! I'll ask why he's always avoiding me! How many hours, minutes, seconds, earth revolutions will he avoid me for?!
c344_10_true3	I don't want to be an easily forgettable one-hit wonder. This is just how I do things. You don't understand me, that's all!
c344_10_victory	How was that? Pretty good, right?
c344_11_boss_long	It's been forever!\It's me, Isolde!
c344_11_boss_short	Were you dying to see me that much?
c344_11_ctskill	If it doesn't hurt, I try harder!
c344_11_death_1	We're finished already?
c344_11_death_2	I'll take you on again...
c344_11_drive	That one hurt!
c344_11_hit_1	Aaah!
c344_11_hit_2	That hurts!
c344_11_hit_3	Another like that, please!
c344_11_prskill	I'll show you how my hard work's paid off!
c344_11_skill	You can't be careless!
c344_11_spa	A little break really does give your life a boost of energy.
c344_11_startbt	Let me show off how hard I work at least today!
c344_11_story1	It's like a dream, don't you think?\I bet you do...\This is Elysion, an absolute dream of an island!\And I am your host and star of Summer Scandal, Isolde!
c344_11_story2	1% courage, 99% concentrated force of will!\And in this match you'll see that power!
c344_11_story3	Who was it that asked me just a moment ago\to stop you if you tried to go gambling?!\Don't do it, Anemone!
c344_11_true1	Another day, another chance to give it 100%!
c344_11_true2	It's not easy being both an MC\and playing beach volleyball!\But I always give everything my best!
c344_11_true3	That Anemone...\She never changes.\So, I'm gonna change her!
c344_11_victory	I knew it! Hard work does pay off!
c344_89_boss_long	The court is my stage!
c344_89_boss_short	I'm in the court now!
c344_89_bubble_prskill	I'm going all out!
c344_89_bubble_skill	Spike!
c344_89_ctskill	Here I go!
c344_89_death_1	I couldn't block it.
c344_89_death_2	I don't wanna lose yet.
c344_89_drive	I'm the super ace!
c344_89_hit_1	Ow ow owww!
c344_89_hit_2	Woops, that backfired!
c344_89_hit_3	Yikes!
c344_89_hit_4	I'm so done!
c344_89_hit_5	Time out! Time out!
c344_89_hit_6	Nope nope nope nope nope!
c344_89_hit_7	Waaah!
c344_89_hit_8	Urgh!
c344_89_hit_9	Ahhh!
c344_89_prskill	Match point!
c344_89_skill	Take that!
c344_boss_long	Hard work'll definitely betray you! Oops! I got it wrong!
c344_boss_short	I, Isolde, will take you on!

c345_89_skill	Steppin' onto the field!
c345_boss_long	Sports arenas are packed with enthusiasm! It's amazing!
c345_boss_short	Final set! Ready!
c345_ctskill	Hey, timeout!
c345_death_1	No... I can...keep going.

c345_spa	Mmm. Wanna bet who can stay in longest?
c345_startbt	Here we go!
c345_story1	It ain't over 'till I bet some money!
c345_story2	When Isolde gets to lecturing she's super stern. She talks all standoffish like and it really gets my goat.
c345_story3	Ain't no point in goin' that far for your Childs.
c345_true1	Just go all in for a killing. There'll be no end if you save up little by little.
c345_true2	My pactmaker remembers me all proper like. Ain't that weird?
c345_true3	Hmph, my job got a bit harder thanks to you. I'm gonna get you back for that!
c345_victory	Aaah! That was sooo tiring!
c346_02_boss_long	Tristan here. Ugh... This is gonna be a pain.
c346_02_boss_short	I'm not ready yet.

c346_02_death_1	Well fine... Whatever.
c346_02_death_2	Daaah!
c346_02_drive	Gamewinner Spike!

c346_02_prskill	Gorilla attaaack!
c346_02_skill	My turn!
c346_02_spa	I'm just gonna nap for a bit. Wake me later. *sigh*
c346_02_startbt	Tease me and you might just wind up dead.
c346_02_story1	Ahem! Don't meddle so much in relationships! If you're gonna focus on anyone, focus on me!
c346_02_story2	Ugh... Okay, okay. I'll do as you say, Mona. I'll match the master, I promise.
c346_02_story3	Uh, even if I look like a gorilla, that doesn't mean I AM one. So stop feeding me bananas for all three meals like you did before.
c346_02_true1	Anemone's so cool. Don't hurt her. If you do, I'll be mad.
c346_02_true2	Isolde is...kinda... Yeah. Why're you asking me that? You don't wanna know anything else about me?
c346_02_true3	No matter what anyone says, I'm fond of my team. Anemone is cool and Isolde is...honest. They let someone like me on their team, after all.
c346_02_victory	*yawn* Can I sleep now?

c347_drive	The day of judgment has arrived!
c347_hit_1	Guh...!
c347_hit_2	Enough!
c347_hit_3	Gah...
c347_prskill	I will show you proof of your ruin.
c347_skill	Begone.
c347_spa	I am the guardian who never slumbers.\Yet you dare tell me to "rest"?
c347_startbt	Do not be afraid.\Salvation will come to you.
c347_story1	I am the bright morning star—the guard who never sleeps. I am alpha and omega.\But what do you know?
c347_story2	What is it that you find unsatisfactory?\There is one doll, but two who seek to play with it.\Therefore, it must be split into two.
c347_story3	For everything, there is a season.\Leave all your burdens and cares with me. I will grant your every wish.
c347_true1	You who exist in darkness.\One who stumbles, unable to see the light.\A soul that crumbles to dust in the sun.
c347_true2	There is nothing I cannot grant.\My words fall upon the earth and bear fruit.
c347_true3	While up in the highest heights,\I saw you in the lowest depths, and I descended.\Come meet your God, Demon.
c347_victory	Glorify me.
c348_boss_long	It's me, Mars♥, your Sweet Devi Princess!
c348_boss_short	Welcome, my lil' Devis!

c348_prskill	Time to sweeten you up!
c348_skill	This is it, darling!
c348_spa	Hehehe, seeing me has made this an ultra special/day for you, I bet!
c348_startbt	We are...\Planet Party!
c348_story1	Hi! My name's Mars♥!\I'm your Sweet-Devi Princess who's come all the way to Earth! Thanks for your support!\Pretty, Sweet, Devi-Sexy~★
c348_story2	Nice! You all pass! Thank you for the love, everyone!\Alrighty then, let's start today's show with a bang!
c348_story3	Hurry up and get over here my lil' Devis!\I'm putting you under my spell.\Pretty, Sweet, Devi-Sexy~★
c348_true1	Well, if it isn't Aria's master.\What do you want? If you're not here for anything, get out of my way.
c348_true2	DVL49 topped the charts again this month.\I gotta work even harder.\Whoa, hold up, did you just hear that?!\Forget it! Forget I said anything! Ugh!
c348_true3	Those apathetic eyes and poofy rooster hair of yours aren't sweet at all. And yet...I kinda like them. I hope Aria doesn't find you.\Would you mind staying with me a bit longer?
c348_victory	Encore time!
c349_boss_long	I-I'm the mysterious leader...Saturn♥.
c349_boss_short	It's me, Saturn♥. Let's all do our best.
c349_ctskill	One, two...
c349_death_1	Oh... I guess this concert...bombed.
c349_death_2	Give me...one more chance.
c349_drive	Let's all sing together!
c349_hit_1	Ugh, once more...
c349_hit_2	Aaah!
c349_hit_3	I'm fine!
c349_prskill	This song is for you.
c349_skill	Okay, all together now!
c349_spa	Proper skin care is important.\Hehehe... It's kinda fun.
c349_startbt	We are...\Planet Party!
c349_story1	I guess... you're right. Maestro, you don't have to hide it from me. You wouldn't lose my trust.
c349_story2	She really is an amazing person, isn't she? Well, please let her know we'd be happy to see her either way.
c349_story3	Okay. I'm going to put on the show MY way—the way only I can! Saturn♥... You've got this, girl!
c349_true1	It's good to see you again.\You're so nice, just like Maestro.
c349_true2	Maestro may seem strict, but he's really very kind.\Hehe... He's a bit like you, actually.
c349_true3	I dream every so often.\I see myself on a giant stage, with the audience endlessly cheering for an encore.\I keep singing and singing, without collapsing like I usually do.\Would you be able to make this dream a reality?
c349_victory	*huff* *huff* That was a fun concert!
c350_boss_long	Pu...Pure Smile, Neptune♥ here!
c350_boss_short	I'm gonna go all out. Just you watch!
c350_ctskill	Leave it to me!
c350_death_1	Give me...another chance!
c350_death_2	I'm not giving up!
c350_drive	May this song touch you!
c350_hit_1	Lemme try that again!
c350_hit_2	Grrr...
c350_hit_3	Owww...
c350_prskill	Cheer me on!
c350_skill	Let's all sing together!
c350_spa	I'm kinda scared of water, but...\I'm an adult now, so...!
c350_startbt	I-I'm in the center? Whaaat?!
c350_story1	*gasp* The flyer was barely in their hands for a second!\... The three second rule applies to flyers, right?\See? Good as new!
c350_story2	We may not be as dazzling an act as Aria,\but I'd love for you to see how much we've\grown!
c350_story3	I want to dedicate this song to someone very important to me. I hope it reaches you, wherever you are.\I'll be singing with all I've got!
c350_true1	You say all demons hate being indebted to someone?\Maestro said he owes you\a huge debt.
c350_true2	I don't really understand battles or the Archfiend Contest, but I'll do everything within my power!
c350_true3	There's actually someone I wanna see,\but I don't know how. Hehe...\Would you help me look for them?
c350_victory	My name is Neptune♥! And don't you forget it!
c351_boss_long	Gather 'round! My act is starting!
c351_boss_short	Finally, it's my turn!

c351_drive	Now it's my turn!
c351_hit_1	Haha! You were careless.
c351_hit_2	Guh...
c351_hit_3	Ugh...
c351_prskill	LOVE Venus♥ ♪
c351_skill	Everyone cheer, it's me, Venus♥!
c351_spa	Hahaha! This is a pretty fun side show!
c351_startbt	Okay, time to have some fun!
c351_story1	Right then, time to go find the oaf.\I can't wait to see what hijinks you entertain me with this time,\my dear goof of a friend. Hehehe.
c351_story2	Huh, I do get the feeling you're\none too fond of me.\Is there a reason for that?
c351_story3	It's like a flame, short lived but so beautiful.\And then when it's over and you've given everything you've got. That feeling of release? It ain't half bad.
c351_true1	I never thought I'd stay in the Mortal Realm for such a long time, but it's a pretty fun place.\You must let me try these "game" things you love so much.
c351_true2	I simply cannot believe\Mars♥ had another fight with Aria and is moping again.\What's with that look?\It's not like I'm worried about her or anything!
c351_true3	Recently I was mobbed by about thirty fans and...they were all Archfiend candidates.\Having that much competition is a pain, so I knocked them all out.\What, that scares you? Relax, I'll let you live. Well? Aren't you happy to hear that? Haha...
c351_victory	What? It's over already?
c353_boss_long	The greater the foe, the more my lance thirsts for battle!
c353_boss_short	I will be more than a match for you!
c353_ctskill	You will be but rust on my lance!
c353_death_1	I live for my spear to serve the light.
c353_death_2	A knight never truly dies...
c353_drive	Lance spiral!
c353_hit_1	Haaa
c353_hit_2	Braggart!
c353_hit_3	Hardy fool!
c353_prskill	Lance charge!
c353_skill	Strike at the heart!
c353_spa	Even a proud knight must at times seek respite.
c353_startbt	To battle!
c353_story1	I forge myself anew.\In doing so, I may confront those that would do my lord harm.
c353_story2	A member of the nobility such as yourself should not be burdened with such trivial matters.
c353_story3	Nor do I think that wearing such an outfit might cause you to speak kindly to me, as you did to the maiden who was wearing it earlier...
c353_true1	I will do as my lord commands.
c353_true2	I am a knight. My pride is in loyalty and truth.
c353_true3	I will follow you wherever fate divines. And I will be my lord's lance.
c353_victory	Surely you saw it! The brilliance of my lance in battle!

c361_hit_1	How annoying!
c361_hit_2	Not again.
c361_hit_3	What?
c361_prskill	Hah hah! I look scary, don't I?
c361_skill	Fools.
c361_spa	Why can't you shut up? Do I have to wipe you out?
c361_startbt	What do you want?
c361_story1	So, she wants that human to be her "companion," eh?\Can't wait to see how that plays out.
c361_story2	*yawn* I'm getting sick of sleeping.\I want to start moving.
c361_story3	Bathory stabbed her own mother.\You should have seen the look on her face when she did it.
c361_true1	Who's worse? A demon\or a snake that eats demons? Teehee!
c361_true2	There are idiots everywhere. I don't understand\why I can't just destroy the entire world.
c361_true3	Were you happy having fun without me?\Hmph. I was waiting for you.
c361_victory	Did you like that?
c362_10_boss_long	Mistress Eve, where are you?
c362_10_boss_short	Mistress Eve? Mistress Eeeve?
c362_10_ctskill	I can take this!
c362_10_death_1	Mistress...Eve...

c362_10_spa	Ahhh! I-I-I'm sorry!\Weird. I thought it was reserved.\I'll get out now.
c362_10_startbt	Please come with me!
c362_10_story1	Should Mistress Eve and I need your help,\well, please and thanks!
c362_10_story2	I'll get you whatever you want.\If that's a stronger incubus,\I'll work really hard!
c362_10_story3	We'll be together, okay?\What's wrong with taking a new route?
c362_10_true1	Hi there, I'm Mistress Eve's aide, Leo!\She's told me so much about you.\I'll be looking forward to working with you! Hehehe.
c362_10_true2	Mistress Eve said there's courage within me,\but I think she's just trying to build me up.\She's so nice.
c362_10_true3	What? You want to hear more about me? Oh, bother...\Well, let me introduce myself...\Wait, I already did that, huh?\Then, umm, what to do...
c362_10_victory	Nothing strange about that, is there?
c362_11_boss_long	Don't take me lightly!
c362_11_boss_short	I'll do my best, Mistress Eve!
c362_11_ctskill	I can't lose!

c362_11_death_2	Mistress Eve will hear about this!
c362_11_drive	If I do as I learned...!
c362_11_hit_1	Take it easy!
c362_11_hit_2	Let's talk this through!
c362_11_hit_3	I'm gonna get mad if you don't stop!
c362_11_prskill	That's dangerous!
c362_11_skill	If I do this...!
c362_11_spa	When I feel good, I remember Mistress Eve.\She might be lost somewhere again.
c362_11_startbt	Mistress Eve!\Please answer me!
c362_11_story1	Should Mistress Eve and I need your help,\well, please and thanks!
c362_11_story2	I'll get you whatever you want.\If that's a stronger incubus,\I'll work really hard!
c362_11_story3	We'll be together, okay?\What's wrong with taking a new route?
c362_11_true1	Mistress Eve, how mean...\going out without telling me!
c362_11_true2	I want to be an excellent aide\like Mona or Lisa.\That way, Mistress Eve is sure to praise me one day.\Hehehe.
c362_11_true3	I used to dream of becoming a superb aide.\But now, I wish only to help Mistress Eve.
c362_11_victory	I'm the best one for Mistress Eve, after all!
c362_boss_long	Mistress Eve, where are you?
c362_boss_short	Mistress Eve? Mistress Eeeve?
c362_ctskill	I can take this!
c362_death_1	Mistress...Eve...

c362_spa	Ahhh!\I-I-I'm sorry!\Weird. I thought it was reserved.\I'll get out now!
c362_startbt	Please come with me!
c362_story1	Should Mistress Eve and I need your help,\well, please and thanks!
c362_story2	I'll get you whatever you want.\If that's a stronger incubus,\I'll work really hard!
c362_story3	We'll be together, okay?\What's wrong with taking a new route?
c362_true1	Hi there, I'm Mistress Eve's aide, Leo!\She's told me so much about you.\I'll be looking forward to working with you! Hehehe.
c362_true2	Mistress Eve said there's courage within me,\but I think she's just trying to build me up.\She's so nice.
c362_true3	What? You want to hear more about me? Oh, bother...\Well, let me introduce myself...\Wait, I already did that, huh?\Then, umm, what to do...
c362_victory	Nothing strange about that, is there?
c363_boss_long	Uhhh...where's the treasure?
c363_boss_short	Where's the next challenger?
c363_ctskill	Gotcha!
c363_death_1	Well, that was a bust...\hahah...
c363_death_2	See ya next time...
c363_drive	You're too late!
c363_hit_1	Ouch!
c363_hit_2	You're good.
c363_hit_3	Ooof!
c363_prskill	Treasure belongs to me!
c363_skill	Don't ignore me!
c363_spa	This place is freakin' great.\I gotta tell Logan about this!
c363_startbt	Sock it to me!
c363_story1	Heh.\I always land my targets.\That's what the of PHAN+IC phantom thieves do!
c363_story2	I'm gonna search for something worthy of the PHAN+IC phantom thieves,\something famous!
c363_story3	If you don't hand it over, I'll steal it!\I know what I'm stealing tonight:\a demon's precious game console!
c363_true1	Really?\Couldn't care less about phantom thieves?\Heh heh heh.\You're gonna regret saying that.
c363_true2	It should be obvious!\There's nothing the PHAN+IC phantom thieves can't steal!
c363_true3	A demon without ambition?\Are you sure you're okay?\Can we really work together?
c363_victory	Mission complete!
c364_boss_long	You don't seem to be the one.
c364_boss_short	You're not my type.
c364_ctskill	Hurry and hide!
c364_death_1	But I wanted a happy ending...
c364_death_2	Aaah!
c364_drive	La dolce vita!
c364_hit_1	Aaah!
c364_hit_2	Ugh!
c364_hit_3	Eee...
c364_prskill	I think I can sink my teeth in here...
c364_skill	Here I go!
c364_spa	Mmm, it's like my stress is melting away...\Oops. My candy melted away too. Hehe... ♥
c364_startbt	I got some extra-sweet candy ready!
c364_story1	I don't really care about Valentine's Day.\All I actually care about is the confession of love!
c364_story2	Teehee. You, my pactmaker, me...\We're all still children, aren't we?\We don't know what love really is...
c364_story3	Eee! Really?! Really really? I'm going to write about this in my diary! "Today is the day that cute Mr. Demon confessed his love to me!"
c364_true1	I wonder... If I stay with you, will I learn what love truly is?
c364_true2	I don't know who first said that\"It is better to have loved and lost than never loved at all,"\but I couldn't agree more.
c364_true3	Here you go, little demon! Have some of my special mint candy!\Don't worry, I didn't put anything weird in it.
c364_victory	Well done, little demon.
c365_boss_long	Devil Buster Unit No. 1, Lisa, activated.
c365_boss_short	All systems green.
c365_ctskill	There's your weak point.
c365_death_1	All systems...shutting down...
c365_death_2	The operation...failed...
c365_drive	Firing at maximum output!
c365_hit_1	Armor damaged.
c365_hit_2	This is nothing...
c365_hit_3	Damage report.
c365_prskill	Commence total annihilation.
c365_skill	Target locked.
c365_spa	Don't worry,\I'm waterproof.
c365_startbt	Witness the power of Devil Buster Unit No. 1.
c365_story1	'Energy levels have dropped to 50%.'\Switching from extermination mode to power-saving mode.
c365_story2	If you would like I can carry it for you.\I was able to replenish some energy, so it is all right.\Please hand me your bag.
c365_story3	System report.\Devil Buster Unit No. 1, rebooting.
c365_true1	The emergency evacuation mode just doesn't feel right. Besides, I'm not a passenger vehicle. Wh-Why are you looking at me like that?
c365_true2	'Anti-Archfiend Artillery Devil Buster Unit No. 1, Lisa.' If I'm No. 1, does that mean there's a No. 2 as well? If there is, I hope it's red.
c365_true3	Davi put stickers on me yesterday. She seems to think I'm some sort of passenger vehicle.
c365_victory	All targets eliminated.
c366_boss_long	I knew you'd make it this far!
c366_boss_short	I've been waiting for you.
c366_ctskill	Let's duke it out, Mr. Demon!
c366_death_1	I can do so much more...
c366_death_2	Aaaagh!
c366_drive	Don't let go of my hand!
c366_hit_1	Eek!
c366_hit_2	Ooof!
c366_hit_3	I failed!
c366_prskill	I can't afford to lose here!
c366_skill	Do you trust me?
c366_spa	We put in another day of hard work today, so let's just kick back\and not worry about what's in store tomorrow.
c366_startbt	Underestimate me and you'll pay!
c366_story1	I use to commit blunders all the time, but I'm totally different now!\I'm confident I can take down any enemy!
c366_story2	I thought my best was good enough,\but I just caused everyone trouble.
c366_story3	No matter how strong your flame,\it won't work on me!
c366_true1	If you work at it, your dreams will come true, right?\What's my dream?\Hmm... Let's see...\Let me think about it!
c366_true2	No matter how tough it gets, I'll pull through.\Just watch me, Mr. Demon.
c366_true3	When I was about to give up, you offered me a hand, Mr. Demon.\Now it's my turn.\Let me be your strength.
c366_victory	I really gave it my all!
c367_boss_long	How would you like to eat my boots?
c367_boss_short	Oh ho ho ho ho! It is I, Archfiend Davi!
c367_ctskill	Witness my true power!
c367_death_1	How dare you...
c367_death_2	*sigh*
c367_drive	Now, kneel!
c367_hit_1	Aaah!
c367_hit_2	Eeek!
c367_hit_3	Agh!
c367_prskill	Try this on for size.
c367_skill	Aaah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
c367_spa	If only every day could be like today.
c367_startbt	Leave this to me!
c367_story1	It is I, Davi, the new Archfiend!\So, like, good to meet you and stuff.
c367_story2	You may fool God, but you'll never fool Archfiend Davi!
c367_story3	You're saying that I, Archfiend Davi, am nothing but a well-educated stalker?
c367_true1	Monaaa ♥ I, Archfiend Davi, am going to make you my wife!
c367_true2	*sigh* When will I get to go back to the Infernal Realm...\This is all your fault, too!
c367_true3	It's all your fault that my plans failed!
c367_victory	Heh heh heh!\That was nothing!
c370_89_boss_long	The final boss takes the stage!
c370_89_boss_short	Oooh, look at you be so embarrassed! ♥
c370_89_bubble_prskill	Splashing Wave!
c370_89_bubble_skill	Come, Tsunami!
c370_89_ctskill	Get ready to be teased!
c370_89_death_1	The sun was...too hot.
c370_89_death_2	Let's meet again...next summer.
c370_89_drive	Powerful sunrays are no problem!
c370_89_hit_1	How mean!
c370_89_hit_2	My my my!
c370_89_hit_3	That hurts!
c370_89_hit_4	Teehee!
c370_89_hit_5	Eek!
c370_89_hit_6	Ugh!
c370_89_hit_7	You little rascal.
c370_89_hit_8	Now I'm angry!
c370_89_hit_9	Aaah!
c370_89_prskill	Tsunaaami waaarning ♥
c370_89_skill	How do you like this?
c370_boss_long	You can't ignore the summer sun.
c370_boss_short	Happy summer ♥
c370_ctskill	Come on, focus!
c370_death_1	Next time...I'll definitely...
c370_death_2	I'm feeling a little out of sorts.
c370_drive	Let's have some more fun!
c370_hit_1	Owww!
c370_hit_2	Look at you be so embarrassed!
c370_hit_3	Ugh, I'm done with you!
c370_prskill	No running now.
c370_skill	What a wonderful day.
c370_spa	*sigh* Nothing like a soak to take away the weariness of travel!
c370_startbt	If you pluck up your courage, we can have even more fun.
c370_story1	You hate summer because it's hot?\That's the whole point of summer!
c370_story2	But you were born among the burning flames of hell, weren't you?\Teehee, I kid. Let's head back for today. It would be bad if you fainted on us.
c370_story3	The glittering sun. A vacation at the beach. Excited shouts. Sea creatures. These are all things you can't find in the Infernal Realm. We should enjoy them more.
c370_true1	My, those rays sure are strong.\Maaaster, would you rub some oil on me?\Oh! Where are you going?!
c370_true2	There's a time to fight and a time to rest!\So be sure to take a break once in a while!
c370_true3	Teehee, we've come this far. Let's have some more fun ♥ Though you look exhausted already. Hehehe!
c370_victory	Even the scorching sun is no match for me ♥
c371_boss_long	UV rays totally blocked! What a nice day it is.
c371_boss_short	You're scowling at a time like this? Heehee.
c371_ctskill	Enough joking around.
c371_death_1	Ah... Did I get heatstroke?
c371_death_2	I can't believe I...messed up.
c371_drive	Over here!
c371_hit_1	Aaah!
c371_hit_2	You won't get away with that.
c371_hit_3	Quit it already!
c371_prskill	You're too relaxed.
c371_skill	Hehehe!
c371_spa	Going from a cold to hot water is seriously heavenly. *sigh*
c371_startbt	I suppose I could lend a hand this once.
c371_story1	Seeing you reminds me of my past self. I was always tense and irritated. I might just be able to help you out.
c371_story2	True, it'll probably be hard for a cat demon such as yourself to love the water. My mistake. Then shall we start by practicing the flutter kick?
c371_story3	It's fine if you can't swim. You can use a floatie. Just bite down on it if you can't use your hands. No need to think deeply about it.
c371_true1	Whether you're a workaholic or not, holidays are fun. What, that's not something I'd usually say? Haha, you might be right.
c371_true2	Go on and have fun. Perhaps the cause of your melancholy is a lack of vitamin D.
c371_true3	I won't work all the way out here. Haha, you really misunderstand me. There's a time to work and a time to rest. That's the only way to stay in top condition.
c371_victory	I have returned. There is nothing to report.
c372_boss_long	Didja know? The stupid rooster head can't swim!
c372_boss_short	C'mere!
c372_ctskill	Take this! Davi's secret attack!
c372_death_1	Waaah!
c372_death_2	Idiot! I'm never playing with you again!
c372_drive	Ah! Waaah! My ice cream!
c372_hit_1	Waaah!
c372_hit_2	Bad demon!
c372_hit_3	You won't get away with that!
c372_prskill	Play with me!
c372_skill	Hurry and hide!
c372_spa	I like the sea more than hot springs.
c372_startbt	I'm not doing it even if you ask!
c372_story1	Maaaster, is it true that you can't swim cuz you're a cat? But cats can swim, can't they? That's just an excuse, isn't it?
c372_story2	Spring, summer, autumn, winter?!\Anyway, that means summer's coming again, right?\So you gotta learn how to swim next summer!
c372_story3	You can't do anything!\You're the worst! I'm worried about you!\You're the cause of all my headaches, you know!
c372_true1	Hehe. I swam all day and now I'm hungry.\Maaaster, gimme some fooood!
c372_true2	Ha ha ha! Want me to teach you how to swim?\You do this, then relax and lay back, and...\There! You're floating! Huh? That's hard?
c372_true3	I wanna play like this every day! Let's forget about the Archfiend Contest and splash around in the water! You'd prefer that anyway, right, Master?
c372_victory	I win again! As if there was any doubt!
c373_boss_long	Let's get this party started!
c373_boss_short	Put your back into it!
c373_ctskill	Take this!
c373_death_1	Ah! I lost my touch.
c373_death_2	The rest is up to you.
c373_drive	Hey, guys! Having fun?
c373_hit_1	Ugh!
c373_hit_2	Ooof!
c373_hit_3	Not bad!
c373_prskill	Stay out of my way!
c373_skill	Alley-oop!
c373_spa	Ahh, I feel it in my bones...\Oop, almost fell asleep back there.
c373_startbt	I'll show you how power is meant to be used.
c373_story1	You know what phrase I've always liked? "Carpe Diem." 'Course, I won't be seizing any day, really, now that I've assumed my place...
c373_story2	You want him to live, don't you? We have to do all we can, bro!
c373_story3	Power's just a means to an end, see? And the end, in my case, is fixing a strained relationship. I won't misuse my power anymore.
c373_true1	You say you want to do this or that? Just go for it! Steel yourself first, though.
c373_true2	You can't ever run away. Regret etches itself in your heart. You take it wherever you go.
c373_true3	I've done all I want for too long.\I've gotta just go for it.\So, wait for me a little longer! Like that!
c373_victory	Hah! That was easy!
c374_boss_long	All right!\Who's got their sights set on my little customer?
c374_boss_short	Don't mess with my love!
c374_ctskill	Take cover behind me, little customer. ♥
c374_death_1	I don't wanna go before my little customer, but...
c374_death_2	I wanted to play with the little customer...some more...
c374_drive	Play with me some more. ♥
c374_hit_1	Ow...
c374_hit_2	Ouchie...
c374_hit_3	Ahh!
c374_prskill	I'll tear you to pieces. ♥
c374_skill	Let me help you. ♥
c374_spa	Oh,\I am just so,\so happy right now! ♥\I'm sure you're even more delighted, though.\Hee hee! ♥
c374_startbt	Did you call for me,\little customer? ♥
c374_story1	It's okay, Morgan.\We don't need a ring. ♥\You know, if you want love,\all you need is a little courage and you're set. ♥
c374_story2	My wish is for you\to wear that wedding dress\one more time! ♥
c374_story3	Oh, he's just so shy.\If I'm too aggressive, he runs away.\It gets a little lonely sometimes.\Maybe that's why I was having that dream.
c374_true1	What do you think of my wedding dress?\Oh, I forgot the bouquet.\That's okay, though.\Guns suit me better than flowers. ♥
c374_true2	Why I like you, little customer?\With how cute you are, isn't it obvious?\You're so cute I wanna mess you up! ♥
c374_true3	What do I have to do to get the little customer to understand my feelings?\Hugging and saying "I love you" haven't worked.\Maybe if I tied him to the bed and cuddled everyday?
c374_victory	Little customer, you're the best!
c377_10_boss_long	Y-Y-You sully the title of bride!
c377_10_boss_short	Do not ruin my wedding!
c377_10_ctskill	Naughty children must be punished!
c377_10_death_1	It seems this is it for me...
c377_10_death_2	Just once more...you...
c377_10_drive	You're mine!
c377_10_hit_1	Ugh...
c377_10_hit_2	Impossible...
c377_10_hit_3	Why, you!
c377_10_prskill	Do not look away.
c377_10_skill	Take my hand.
c377_10_spa	Trying to shake off those marriage blues, hmm?\Makes sense. I was just thinking I needed some time off, myself.
c377_10_startbt	I've come to take my bride.
c377_10_story1	It's not as if I'm asking her to marry me this instant.\I'm willing to wait 1,000—\or even 2,000—years until she's ready.
c377_10_story2	I'm not particularly fixated on finding a female partner.\Even you would do.\What do you say,\will you marry me?
c377_10_story3	Let me just say this: I am not so foolish as to let a blue bird\twice slip from my grasp.
c377_10_true1	*sigh* To think things would become so complicated...\Is this what wearing clothes that don't fit me was all about?\Could the Bride's Ring...\...be cursed?
c377_10_true2	Who would have thought I would come looking for a bride,\but become one instead?!\Who could've imagined such a scheme?
c377_10_true3	How am I to explain this to the bride candidates\so they'll understand?\Ending up with two brides...
c377_10_victory	Does the goddess of victory smile upon me?
c377_11_boss_long	Welcome, my bride.
c377_11_boss_short	I was waiting for you.
c377_11_ctskill	You think yourself worthy of touching me?!
c377_11_death_1	Such dissatisfying\final moments.
c377_11_death_2	I want to see...your face again.
c377_11_drive	You shall receive my love!
c377_11_hit_1	Ugh...
c377_11_hit_2	How could this...?!
c377_11_hit_3	Gah...
c377_11_prskill	I won't let you take your eyes off me!
c377_11_skill	You've been bad, little one!
c377_11_spa	The hot spring?\It's my first time at one. It's all right.
c377_11_startbt	Together to the end of the world!
c377_11_story1	It's not as if I'm asking her to marry me this instant.\I'm willing to wait 1,000—\or even 2,000—years until she's ready.
c377_11_story2	I'm not particularly fixated on finding a female partner.\Even you would do.\What do you say,\will you marry me?
c377_11_story3	Let me just say this: I am not so foolish as to let a blue bird\twice slip from my grasp.
c377_11_true1	Do not speak to me so brazenly.\Am I that strange?
c377_11_true2	It's as though I'm in a dream...or a nightmare.\Where am I?\What have I...
c377_11_true3	The Bride's Ring is as its name implies.\Only a beautiful,\strong bride can wear it.\And yet...
c377_11_victory	Now, for the kiss of victory!
c377_89_boss_long	Y-Y-You sully the title of bride!
c377_89_boss_short	Do not ruin my wedding!
c377_89_bubble_prskill	How about a demon's wedding march?
c377_89_bubble_skill	Did you let down your guard?
c377_89_ctskill	Naughty children must be punished!
c377_89_death_1	It seems this is it for me...
c377_89_death_2	Just once more...you...
c377_89_drive	You're mine!
c377_89_hit_1	Ugh...
c377_89_hit_2	Impossible...
c377_89_hit_3	Why, you...!
c377_89_hit_4	Unforgivable!
c377_89_hit_5	Finished already?
c377_89_hit_6	Don't make me laugh.
c377_89_hit_7	Cease this futile struggle!
c377_89_hit_8	Do not interfere!
c377_89_hit_9	How troublesome.
c377_89_prskill	Do not look away.
c377_89_skill	Take my hand.
c377_boss_long	I was waiting for you to come.
c377_boss_short	Hello, my bride.
c377_ctskill	The time for games has ended!
c377_death_1	I let you see...a most disgraceful display.
c377_death_2	Just one more time...here...
c377_drive	Leave your fate in my hands!
c377_hit_1	Why, you...
c377_hit_2	Is that all?
c377_hit_3	Ugh!
c377_prskill	Focus on me!
c377_skill	I shall protect you.
c377_spa	Trying to shake off those marriage blues, hmm?\Makes sense. I was just thinking I needed some time off, myself.
c377_startbt	I vow my eternal love for you.
c377_story1	It's not as if I'm asking her to marry me this instant.\I'm willing to wait 1,000—\or even 2,000—years until she's ready.
c377_story2	I'm not particularly fixated on finding a female partner.\Even you would do.\What do you say,\will you marry me?
c377_story3	Let me just say this: I am not so foolish as to let a blue bird\twice slip from my grasp.
c377_true1	I don't mind if you playfully call me Ippy\or something like that.\After all, you're one of my fated bride candidates,\are you not?
c377_true2	I haven't seen my father since my infancy,\nor have I any such interest.\He's surely off enjoying his life somewhere.
c377_true3	Since coming here I've come to realize\what a persistent personality I possess.\And you, Pomona, have the worst of luck.\Hahaha. You think me strange, too, don't you?
c377_victory	I dedicate this victory to you.
c378_boss_long	Hmph, I'll crush you.
c378_boss_short	Get on with it. You're gone all the same.
c378_ctskill	Be gone! You're nothing but an eyesore!
c378_death_1	You'd go this far... Urgh.
c378_death_2	This isn't over...
c378_drive	Get outta the way if you don't wanna get hurt!
c378_hit_1	Ow!
c378_hit_2	Ugh, you think you've got me?!
c378_hit_3	Aaah!
c378_prskill	Hah, let darkness swallow you!
c378_skill	Hah, you're in the way!
c378_spa	Ahhh. Sometimes a nice soak is exactly what the doctor ordered.
c378_startbt	Hahaha! Come on. I'll toss you around like the trash you are.
c378_story1	You tryin' to mess with me, Athena?!
c378_story2	I keep having dreams about fighting her. And every single time, it ends with her beating me.
c378_story3	We're like polar opposites, aren't we? I guess that's why things are like this...
c378_true1	I keep having nightmares... It's been like this ever since becoming a Child.
c378_true2	Beings of light and darkness, born from the same human.\That's my relation to Athena.
c378_true3	The other side of love? Don't make me laugh.\There's no way that's even a thing.
c378_victory	Hmph, I doubt we'll warm up to each other.
c379_boss_long	I, Athena, will be your opponent!
c379_boss_short	Your knee will bend before my shield!
c379_ctskill	Agh, charge!
c379_death_1	Master...may we meet again...
c379_death_2	Gaaah!
c379_drive	I command you. Come forth, Aegis!
c379_hit_1	Urgh!
c379_hit_2	Ugh, I can still fight!
c379_hit_3	This is nothing!
c379_prskill	You will go no further!
c379_skill	Haaah!
c379_spa	Bathing in the nude... How shameless!
c379_startbt	I will be your shield!
c379_story1	I'm supposed to look out for her. Guide her. What should I do now...?
c379_story2	Hm. I've honestly never even considered\having an opinion about such things.\I've only ever lived for her...\My sole existence for being.
c379_story3	I just wanted to learn more about the Mortal Realm.\A-And maybe a little bit about our master, too!
c379_true1	All I ever did was for her. Why couldn't she see that?
c379_true2	I was secondary. My thoughts, my feelings, they were never considered.
c379_true3	From now on, I want to consider others' feelings, while also expressing mine, little by little. And if I could let Master know how I feel, too...
c379_victory	Master, are you all right?
c381_boss_long	Mind if I just surrender?
c381_boss_short	Should I let you go?
c381_ctskill	Did you see that?
c381_death_1	Ugh! The string's coming loose!
c381_death_2	Ohh, forget you!
c381_drive	Notice my feelings!
c381_hit_1	Forgive me, okay?!
c381_hit_2	Aaah!
c381_hit_3	Heeey!
c381_prskill	What kind of girl do you like?
c381_skill	Yaaah!
c381_spa	What have you got on your mind, bringing me to a place like this?\Hm? ...You want to bathe together with me,\is that it?
c381_startbt	I believe in you!
c381_story1	I'm so done with that candy!\I can win his heart without any tricks!
c381_story2	*sigh* That got me nowhere.\This is definitely way harder than just using my candy...\
c381_story3	Whenever I close my eyes, I can still remember him falling in love. What I wouldn't do to see that again.
c381_true1	Here's my special, homemade love candy!\If you have it, you'll find your fated love!\Open up and say ahhh... Well? How is it?
c381_true2	Could you tie my bikini?\Huh? Done already? Umm...this is way too loose.
c381_true3	You could do the sweetest confession, but if you don't mean it, it's worthless. I want to confess to you with my purest feelings.
c381_victory	Oh, what? I won!
c382_10_boss_long	But I was enjoying the party...
c382_10_boss_short	What are you staring at?
c382_10_ctskill	Can you get out of the way?
c382_10_death_1	Don't worry about me...
c382_10_death_2	I'm really sorry. All I did was get in the way.
c382_10_drive	How annoying. Let's get this over with.
c382_10_hit_1	You should fear a woman with a grudge.
c382_10_hit_2	You're underestimating me, aren't you?
c382_10_hit_3	Oh, shut up.
c382_10_prskill	Please, don't act tough.
c382_10_skill	Oh, shoot.
c382_10_spa	What?\If you're going to whine, do it later.\I'm sure you've got nothing good to say.
c382_10_startbt	Do me a favor and be good at the party.
c382_10_story1	According to Lan Fei,\one of the exorcists' Holy Relics\can manipulate time.
c382_10_story2	Lan Fei gave me this dress.\She said it was a present for being a regular.\Isn't it stunning?
c382_10_story3	Stop making pompous claims,\you tactless ignoramus.
c382_10_true1	With this information, Master Frej should be able to stop the rampage.
c382_10_true2	It's an absolutely fabulous dress...\So, naturally, my hopelessly thickheaded Master Frej\is going to have no reaction to it, is he?
c382_10_true3	How disappointing...\Could it be on purpose?\Either way, it's incredibly cruel.
c382_10_victory	That really took it out of me...
c382_boss_long	I don't feel like playing with you.
c382_boss_short	*sigh* Why is this happening?
c382_ctskill	You ignored me again, didn't you?!
c382_death_1	I won't...ever forgive you.
c382_death_2	*sigh* Guess I'm dying in vain.
c382_drive	You can just drop dead!
c382_hit_1	Know your place.
c382_hit_2	How dare you make fun of me!
c382_hit_3	Watch me!
c382_prskill	Don't talk to me!
c382_skill	Oh well. Such is life.
c382_spa	What? If you're going to whine, do it later. I'm sure you've got nothing good to say.
c382_startbt	This is a bit sudden...
c382_story1	I guess I went overboard.\*cough*\Demons should just go to hell.
c382_story2	Ha! I just wanted to work towards survival instead of trusting myself to a stupid demon like Frej. That's why I grabbed some of his hair!
c382_story3	My wish?\It's not like I want life to be fun.\Or even that I want it to be stimulating.\The way it's always been is...
c382_true1	Frej calls me annoying once every two days.\That's my line, stupid Frej.
c382_true2	All demons think the same way.\They're all trash. They should all just be purged.\So...how long do I have to put up with this?
c382_true3	You want to tell me to just do what I want, right?\I'm sure I'm just a pain to you too.\You think I'm weird, don't you?!\Huh? You don't? I don't believe you.
c382_victory	I demand a better work environment.
c383_11_boss_long	Don't regret being so stubborn now.
c383_11_boss_short	Frej's on the scene!
c383_11_ctskill	Is that all you got?
c383_11_death_1	Gah... Stupid...
c383_11_death_2	Don't think...this is...the end!
c383_11_drive	Struggle as hard as you can!
c383_11_hit_1	Why, you...!
c383_11_hit_2	Ha ha!
c383_11_hit_3	We done yet?
c383_11_prskill	You've got guts. I'll give you that.
c383_11_skill	Now, take this!
c383_11_spa	Is there time for this? Man, you're easygoing.
c383_11_startbt	My turn!
c383_11_story1	There's no point in asking me.\I don't remember a thing!
c383_11_story2	True, there's no telling what might happen if you give holy water to an idiot who's constantly trying to kill her Master.
c383_11_story3	Quit being a worrywart. Just shut up and follow me. You're the aide of the next Archfiend, got it?
c383_11_true1	Ugh... I'm so sore. Is it cuz of the Archfiend Contest?\Huh? You're worried? Ha! You should worry about yourself instead!\I'll be in a tough spot if you go and die on me!
c383_11_true2	My aura's different? Don't ask me. The only change I've noticed is how much hotter I am now.
c383_11_true3	What the hell's up with this power? It's swelling up inside me.\It's kinda...weird. I don't like it!
c383_11_victory	This's boring. I'm leaving!
c383_boss_long	Don't regret being so stubborn now.
c383_boss_short	Frej's on the scene!
c383_ctskill	Is that all you got?
c383_death_1	Gah... Stupid...
c383_death_2	Don't think...this is...the end!
c383_drive	Struggle as hard as you can!
c383_hit_1	Why, you...!
c383_hit_2	Ha ha!
c383_hit_3	We done yet?
c383_prskill	You've got guts. I'll give you that.
c383_skill	Now, take this!
c383_spa	Is there time for this? Man, you're easygoing.
c383_startbt	My turn!
c383_story1	There's no point in asking me.\I don't remember a thing!
c383_story2	Yeah, who knows what'll happen if you give holy water to an idiot who's constantly trying to kill her master.
c383_story3	Quit being a worrywart.\Just shut up and follow me.\You're the aide of the next Archfiend, got it?
c383_true1	Ugh... I'm so sore. Is it cuz of the Archfiend Contest?\Huh? You're worried? Ha! You should worry about yourself instead!\I'll be in a tough spot if you go and die on me!
c383_true2	My aura's different? Don't ask me. The only change I've noticed is how much hotter I am now.
c383_true3	What the hell's up with this power? It's swelling up inside me.\It's kinda...weird. I don't like it!
c383_victory	This's boring. I'm leaving!
c385_boss_long	Don't underestimate me just 'cause I'm small!
c385_boss_short	I'll show you what I can really do!
c385_ctskill	Too easy!
c385_death_1	Miss Helena...
c385_death_2	No way... Is this because they're not big enough...?
c385_drive	Let the red rose of blood bloom forth.
c385_hit_1	Ow!
c385_hit_2	Stop that!
c385_hit_3	*sniff*...
c385_prskill	Dance with me!
c385_skill	Yah!
c385_spa	Ahh, this feels so good...\I wish Miss Helena was here, though...
c385_startbt	Let's you and I do our best!
c385_story1	What? You don't believe me?\In that case, I'll just have to show you\what I'm capable of!
c385_story2	Lisa's beautiful, and Mona's so kind...\They both really seem like mature women! I wonder\how I can get others to treat me like a grown-up...
c385_story3	Hey! If you think you can pull a fast one on me like that,\you've got another thing coming!\But thanks... I feel a little better now!
c385_true1	I can't believe Miss Helena told me to go play... \She's been treating me like a child ever since we came here.\I guess I'll just have to show her\how grown-up I am!
c385_true2	My only master is Miss Helena.\You? Are you the islands' owner?\Okay, but don't you go treating me like a child.
c385_true3	You sure are hopeless, aren't you Mr. Owner.\But that's exactly why you need me, isn't it?\Okay, I'll help you out as your servant. But only for a little while, got it?
c385_victory	Yay! I won!
c386_boss_long	I'm ready...
c386_boss_short	This match is mine.
c386_ctskill	Time to end this!
c386_death_1	I can't give up yet...
c386_death_2	I lost...
c386_drive	This is Mugen-Tenshin style!
c386_hit_1	Aaah!
c386_hit_2	How...
c386_hit_3	Oh no you don't!
c386_prskill	Get ready...
c386_skill	This is it!
c386_spa	They say hot springs can cleanse your very soul.\It really is soothing in here...
c386_startbt	I'll do my best!
c386_story1	I'd rather not say yet...\Especially since we don't yet know each other very well...
c386_story2	The texture of the crisp, flakey crust... The smooth sweetness of the cream... Plus, there's just something about strawberries that makes me happy. Do you think that's childish?
c386_story3	It shines a bit of light on something that would otherwise be completely shrouded in darkness...and gives me the courage to keep moving forward.
c386_true1	Could this be the encounter\my fortune told me about...?
c386_true2	P-Please don't stare at me. It's really embarrassing...\I-I said stop that!
c386_true3	It's hard, not knowing what the future holds...\I wonder if you'll help illuminate my future, the way fortune telling does?
c386_victory	You'll never beat me.
c387_boss_long	I'm gonna give it my all!
c387_boss_short	Let's do this thing!
c387_ctskill	Hwacha!
c387_death_1	Aw man, I lost...
c387_death_2	You're too strong...
c387_drive	Let's do this!
c387_hit_1	That hurts!
c387_hit_2	Oh gosh!
c387_hit_3	Not there!
c387_prskill	I did it!
c387_skill	Here goes!
c387_spa	*yawwwn* Hot springs really are the best.\I can feel the stress melting away.
c387_startbt	Let's both give it our all!
c387_story1	You and I would never have met if it weren't for my grandmother. Something good always happens whenever I run an errand for her, you know?
c387_story2	Oh, and I'm really good at copying things! And not just pro-wrestling moves. I mean anything!
c387_story3	S-Stop that!\My chest doesn't have\any secrets!
c387_true1	You'd like my help, Mr. Owner? Of course, I'd be glad to!\I already help out a lot with the town festival, you know.\Huh? You're not talking about the festival? Oh. Hehe...
c387_true2	I'm actually a lot luckier than you might think.\Hm? You don't believe me, do you?\Well, you'll see soon enough, after we spend more time together!
c387_true3	You know, you're kind of like an old man, Mr. Owner.\...Oh! I don't mean that in a bad way!\Being with you kind of feels like being with my grandmother. I really feel at ease around you...
c387_victory	Promise you won't tell anyone, okay?
c390_02_boss_long	Welcome to my show!
c390_02_boss_short	Get ready to have a good time!
c390_02_ctskill	True or false?!

c391_story1	The more you cute young'uns exert yourselves, the more us older demons feel like giving it our all too. ♬ Huh? Or is that backwards? I came here to cheer YOU on, after all.
c391_story2	I'm a looot stronger than you think. Not so much now, but I was preeetty wild in my younger days. ...What, you don't believe me? Hehe!
c391_story3	The ephemerality of dreams is what makes them fun. You need to understand that before you lose yourself. Though if you do...I'll come save you.
c391_true1	Whoa! Typhon! Sheesh...\Get yourself together, okay?! I'm not sure if it was right or wrong to bring you along.
c391_true2	*sigh*\I can't help but worry. Ailill is totally independent, but...Typhon's the main problem. I have to keep a close eye on him.
c391_true3	Huh? You wanna stay with me a little longer? What am I gonna do with you? The party's long, sure, but it'll end eventually. Oh well... I guess I'll stay by your side for a while.
c391_victory	Did you have sweet dreams?
c392_10_boss_long	Mona, look.
c392_10_boss_short	Don't I look cool?
c392_10_ctskill	It's a promise.
c392_10_death_1	Mona...I love you.
c392_10_death_2	Goodbye, Mona...
c392_10_drive	Why do you look away from me?!
c392_10_hit_1	Ooof!
c392_10_hit_2	Urgh!
c392_10_hit_3	Haaa
c392_10_prskill	Lies!
c392_10_skill	Why?
c392_10_spa	I don't wanna go to a place like this with YOU. Where's Mona?
c392_10_startbt	I'll show you what the real Davi looks like.
c392_10_story1	Mona's always gonna be with me,\so I don't feel sad anymore.
c392_10_story2	Thank you. Ah...I have to go.\Goodbye, Master...\Goodbye, Lisa...\Goodbye, Mona.
c392_10_story3	You're right. She does love us.\No matter what we look like.\We're all Davi.\We'll never be apart.
c392_10_true1	Do you know how hard it was\waiting for you in the Infernal Realm?
c392_10_true2	I wanted to be together with you until the end,\but not like this.
c392_10_true3	But I'll revert to the old Davi—\the one everybody knows.
c392_10_victory	I got real strong.
c392_89_boss_long	Mona...I'm right here.
c392_89_boss_short	Don't leave me.
c392_89_bubble_prskill	I'll destroy it all!
c392_89_bubble_skill	Don't run away!
c392_89_ctskill	Outta the way!
c392_89_death_1	Mona...\Don't ever forget me...
c392_89_death_2	I have...to go...
c392_89_drive	I'll show you my real power!
c392_89_hit_1	That's it?
c392_89_hit_2	Ooof!
c392_89_hit_3	Eee!
c392_89_hit_4	...Mona?
c392_89_hit_5	Don't go!
c392_89_hit_6	Guh!
c392_89_hit_7	Ooof!
c392_89_hit_8	I hate you!
c392_89_hit_9	Aaah!
c392_89_prskill	I'll destroy it all!
c392_89_skill	Don't run away!
c392_boss_long	I wanted to see you...\Mona.
c392_boss_short	Mona,\were you doing okay?
c392_ctskill	Outta the way!
c392_death_1	Mona...\don't ever forget me...
c392_death_2	I have...to go...
c392_drive	Love me!
c392_hit_1	Argh!
c392_hit_2	Ack!
c392_hit_3	Mona!
c392_prskill	I do this for Mona!
c392_skill	Will this make Mona happy?
c392_spa	I don't wanna go to a place like this with YOU. Where's Mona?
c392_startbt	I heard Mona's voice.
c392_story1	Mona's always gonna be with me,\so I don't feel sad anymore.
c392_story2	Thank you. Ah...I have to go.\Goodbye, Master...\Goodbye, Lisa...\Goodbye, Mona.
c392_story3	You're right. She does love us.\No matter what we look like.\We're all Davi.\We'll never be apart.
c392_true1	Mona, look.\What do you think\of how I look now?
c392_true2	I don't get it...\What kind of Davi did you have in mind, Mona?\I thought you'd love me if I became the real Davi.\Why are you looking at me like that?
c392_true3	I finally understood when you told me you always loved me\even if I didn't grow up or get strong.\I love you, Mona.\I'll love you forever and ever.
c392_victory	Will you praise me?
c393_10_boss_long	Hello, greedy demon.
c393_10_boss_short	I'm telling you there's no use.
c393_10_ctskill	Let me give you a hand!
c393_10_death_1	You finally...freed me.
c393_10_death_2	I may finally...rest.
c393_10_drive	The buck stops here!
c393_10_hit_1	Is that it?
c393_10_hit_2	Ooof!
c393_10_hit_3	Aaah!
c393_10_prskill	Do you want me that badly?
c393_10_skill	So clumsy.
c393_10_spa	Is it okay for me to be enjoying\the hot spring like this?\Phew... *yawn*
c393_10_startbt	Did you find me pleasing?
c393_10_story1	Become my light\that I may not sink into the darkness.
c393_10_story2	Stand up. You said I was your light, right?\Well, you're mine.\There's light anywhere we look because we...\We are each other's light.
c393_10_story3	However, despite your proposal,\I have no intention to toil beneath you.\There's something more important to me\than serving demons.
c393_10_true1	The past is in the past.\It can't be undone.\A pity, really.
c393_10_true2	To demons,\aides are little more than chess pieces.\They're all like that.\It's just demon nature.
c393_10_true3	My light will never die!\I still have a friend who shines for me.\I will keep shining as long as there is darkness.
c393_10_victory	Who do you have to thank?
c393_boss_long	Show me what you're made of, Mr. Demon.
c393_boss_short	Do you want the Archfiend's throne?
c393_ctskill	I won't let you go that easily!
c393_death_1	How long will this fighting last?
c393_death_2	This is...as far as I go.
c393_drive	Shall I make you Archfiend?!
c393_hit_1	Ooof!
c393_hit_2	Guh!
c393_hit_3	*sigh*
c393_prskill	I've got this!
c393_skill	As you command!
c393_spa	It's rare for an aide to have such a magnanimous demon. Teehee ♥
c393_startbt	Master, I will fight for your sake.
c393_story1	Become my light\that I may not sink into the darkness.
c393_story2	Stand up. You said I was your light, right?\Well, you're mine.\There's light anywhere we look because we...\We are each other's light.
c393_story3	However, despite your proposal,\I have no intention to toil beneath you.\There's something more important to me\than serving demons.
c393_true1	The Archfiend Contest is nothing but a war between demons.\I will fight my own war.\The one to reclaim the light!
c393_true2	Davi... Your loneliness, your grudges—\I will bear them all\so you may find joy within me, forever.
c393_true3	The demons will fight their battles,\and we will ours.\But ultimately, when it's all over,\we'll all be standing on the same path.
c393_victory	Do not forget our struggles.
c394_boss_long	Welcome. 'Tis I, Supreme Courtesan Bathory.
c394_boss_short	Prithee play with me.
c394_ctskill	Thou art unreasonably stubborn.
c394_death_1	Mine fate was ever ephemeral.
c394_death_2	Theresa...
c394_drive	Master, doth do we part.
c394_hit_1	Aaah!
c394_hit_2	Ooof!
c394_hit_3	Such nerve.
c394_prskill	Pray let me handle it.
c394_skill	Forgive me.
c394_spa	Shall I wash thy back, Master?\Tee hee, I'm just kidding.\Oh my, look at you, you're beet red!
c394_startbt	More slowly, I prithee.
c394_story1	A kimono? I've never worn one.\Come to think of it, I enrolled at the school right after coming to the Mortal Realm, so I don't have many clothes besides my uniform.
c394_story2	It turneth out that kimonos are harder to wear than I thought-eth.\'Tis also heavier than I foresaw. What thinketh thee?\Doth it suit me?
c394_story3	So listen to this, Theresa.\I wore a kimono to my first shrine visit of the year.\I wish you could have seen it. Next year, we must to go together.\No matter what.
c394_true1	There's so much to the culture of the courtesan.\A world of women. It's just fascinating to me.\I can't wait to learn more about it at school.
c394_true2	I am Supreme Courtesan Bathory.\What? Can I not pull it off?\Aw, it was really starting to grow on me.
c394_true3	Hmm. The language of courtesans is really hard.\Does this sound right?\Haveth a happy New Year.
c394_victory	If thou shall excuse me, I shall take mine leave.
c395_boss_long	It's been a long time.\Would you mind telling me the way?
c395_boss_short	Huh. Wasn't I here earlier?
c395_ctskill	Move.
c395_death_1	So, here is where it ends?
c395_death_2	I'm going back.
c395_drive	Here, take this.
c395_hit_1	Ugh...
c395_hit_2	I'll clean this up.
c395_hit_3	Hmph.
c395_prskill	Let's make this a fun memory.
c395_skill	How adorable.
c395_spa	Thank you. I feel refreshed now.\I hadn't realized how exhausted\I was.
c395_startbt	I'm going on ahead. Come on.
c395_story1	This? Oh, it's nothing really.\I just remembered something Leo said.\People let down their guard when you're small and cute, apparently.\I'd rather not stand out if I don't need to.
c395_story2	I know I'm not one to talk,\but wasting time like this is...\kinda pointless?
c395_story3	I'm glad I found someone to be my guide, though.\What do you mean who? You, of course.\I couldn't possibly let someone like Frej\get ahead of me.
c395_true1	Seriously, I didn't get any experience in the Infernal Realm.\I was never able to talk to any other demons like this, either.\Was it like that for you, too?
c395_true2	I'm not really big into relating to others.\Rather, I don't really remember doing it much. Like, I could probably count in one hand those who's names I remember.
c395_true3	Leo, don't you see the trouble your master's going through?\Where are you? I'm just so...tired.\Come on, where are you, seriously?
c395_victory	Well done.
c396_boss_long	Never thought I'd see you here!
c396_boss_short	Haha! You got me?
c396_ctskill	I'll bite you!
c396_death_1	Let's meet again someday, Kitty.
c396_death_2	I did not foresee this.
c396_drive	Can you come with me?
c396_hit_1	That's okay!
c396_hit_2	Amazing!
c396_hit_3	Yikes!
c396_prskill	*nibble*! I'm just play-biting.
c396_skill	Awooo!
c396_spa	Hurry up!\I was waiting for you, Kitty!
c396_startbt	Just trust me and follow along!
c396_story1	Heehee.\How about we put this good luck of yours to the test, Kitty?
c396_story2	Hi there, everyone! I've got some great news for each and every one of you!\I have with me here a selection of Wolf Talismans at special New Year's prices that are sure to turn your life around!
c396_story3	Ahahaha! You have no sense of humor at all, do you, Kitty?\Maybe that's why it's so much fun to tease you!
c396_true1	Ah! Did I scare you? Hehe, I did it!\Oh? You're not mad, are you? Aw, come on, you gotta understand. This is all Master's fault. It's cause of him I was born with this personality.
c396_true2	Don't be surprised if I just up and disappear, okay?\I mean, we met suddenly, too.\Even if we go our separate ways, we'll meet again someday. Hehehe.
c396_true3	Hahah! It's been a while since I last heard a compliment!
c396_victory	See? A full moon! Awooo!
c397_boss_long	This feast is on me!
c397_boss_short	Leda Santa is here!
c397_ctskill	Ho! Ho! Ho!
c397_death_1	I wanted to one last Christmas feast...
c397_death_2	I'm so hungry. I can't muster any strength...
c397_drive	Merry Christmas!
c397_hit_1	Aaah!
c397_hit_2	What are you doing?!
c397_hit_3	Don't you want presents?!
c397_prskill	Present Barrage!
c397_skill	You Better Not Pout!
c397_spa	Delivering presents, bringing joy to many people,\and on top of that a nice warm bath. This is the life!
c397_startbt	Naughty children don't get presents!
c397_story1	A fancy Christmas dinner, you say? A buffet of Yuletide yummies?!\Then yes! Count me in! I will even assist personally, if I must!
c397_story2	Those kids—did you see how they smiled through their hunger?\So humbling. It made me realize\how much I fixate on food\when I'M hungry...
c397_story3	As of today, I am no longer Princess Leda, but Leda Claus! Or maybe Leda Santa!\What do you think those children will do when they see a feast lined up on their meager table?\I can hardly wait!
c397_true1	What?! Isn't Christmas a day for trading presents and having some yummy food?!
c397_true2	People's basic needs matter.\Without a home, where do gifts get delivered to? Without a Santa suit, how can I deliver presents?\Without some roast, it doesn't feel like Christmas!
c397_true3	I guess some might say I have a big heart? A princess must have presents to give to the little people!
c397_victory	Hey! Could you give me a hand over here?!
c398_boss_long	I won't be goin' down easy!
c398_boss_short	Is that really all you got?
c398_ctskill	You should come with me!
c398_death_1	You got me...
c398_death_2	Agh...
c398_drive	Lemme bang out a tune for you!
c398_hit_1	Aaah!
c398_hit_2	Oof!
c398_hit_3	What do you think you're doin'?
c398_prskill	Get outta my way!
c398_skill	Dirtbag!
c398_spa	So waaarm... Makes me glad to be alive.
c398_startbt	Make waaay for Jacheongbiii!
c398_story1	It's like they say, when one door closes, another opens!\You'll regret lookin' down on me, Boss,\ya roosterhead!
c398_story2	Sufferin's inevitable,\as much for the livin' as the dead.\Whether you cry or laugh, that's life.
c398_story3	I don't care about your reasons.\I've no intention to sing for you!
c398_true1	I'd never met a demon as unreliable as you.\Must be why your aides are always\draggin' you all over the place.\*sigh* Your future's not lookin' too bright.
c398_true2	You think I'm some kinda dog at your beck and call?\You demons are all the same.\You haven't got an ounce of consideration for your Childs, do you?
c398_true3	Can't do much since ya caught me,\but one of these days I'm gonna get the heck outta here.\Don't expect me to turn around even if you scream or cry.
c398_victory	Now that was a surprise!
c400_boss_long	I...didn't call for you.
c400_boss_short	Sorry. I'm gonna win this one.
c400_ctskill	Sorry for hurting you!
c400_death_1	Am I dying...again?
c400_death_2	I'll become a butterfly...and go see...
c400_drive	If I die, it'll really be over!
c400_hit_1	Ow!
c400_hit_2	Not yet!
c400_hit_3	...
c400_prskill	It's okay to cry!
c400_skill	Why don't you just give up?!
c400_spa	This's a nice place.\I wanted to bring mommy and the others too, but...\I can't, can I?
c400_startbt	This is so exciting.\I wonder if I can win.
c400_story1	You're still pretty weak,\so I can't just leave you in the lurch.\Guess I've got more family to protect now.
c400_story2	I know you can't escape death and all that,\but...I want to protect my family all the same.\I want them to live happily,\even if just a little.
c400_story3	Are you saying you'll die someday?\I don't ever want that to happen.\I'd be super-duper sad if you died.
c400_true1	I didn't think you'd find me.\Thank you, Master.
c400_true2	I was always calling out,\"Daddy, mommy... I'm here."\Your voice will reach that important person one day,\so don't give up.
c400_true3	Now that I look like this, I can't see my family anymore.\It's okay, though. Our hearts are connected.\We're always together.
c400_victory	I decided I wouldn't cry anymore.
c401_boss_long	I came from the Land of Snow to make friends.
c401_boss_short	Will you be my friend?
c401_ctskill	Is everything all right?
c401_death_1	Let's rest a moment.
c401_death_2	We'll see each other again.
c401_drive	Will you join us, YUKINE?
c401_hit_1	Eeek!
c401_hit_2	Aaah!
c401_hit_3	Stop that...
c401_prskill	Let me show you how snow can truly sparkle.
c401_skill	Let's play!
c401_spa	It looks so warm...\We won't melt, will we?
c401_startbt	I've come from the Land of Snow.\Won't you be my friend?
c401_story1	I wonder how they've been since they helped me find my key.\It'd be nice to see them and spend more time together.
c401_story2	I've come to this world from the Land of Snow to have some fun.\But I must've made a wrong turn somewhere, because I ended up here.
c401_story3	I wish I could show you how truly grateful I am...\But it's already time for me to be on my way.\So...thank you, gentle demon.
c401_true1	I wonder what the snow is like in the place you call home.\I would love to see it...
c401_true2	What I would give to show you\the snow crystals in my land\that stay pristine forever...
c401_true3	Everyone I've met here has been so generous to me and YUKINE.\I hope we can see one another again.
c401_victory	I would've been lost without everyone's help.
c402_10_boss_long	Everything must be destroyed!
c402_10_boss_short	Mow them down, Kusanagi!
c402_10_ctskill	This is the power of the Godslayer!
c402_10_death_1	No... Why...?
c402_10_death_2	Does it all end here?
c402_10_drive	My power is destruction!
c402_10_hit_1	Kh...
c402_10_hit_2	Ugh!
c402_10_hit_3	Ah!
c402_10_prskill	Capture!
c402_10_skill	Succumb!
c402_10_spa	I'm still in the midst of my investigation, and yet...
c402_10_startbt	Come, Lux Sanctus!
c402_10_story1	Maybe your master relies on you all too much.\You should tell him to improve his attitude.\I'll help too.
c402_10_story2	Oh, no! Don't worry about it.\I've got it!\We should just look to see where he's gone!
c402_10_story3	Lisa has told me that you lack the proper self-consciousness as an Archfiend candidate. You have such wonderful aides like Lisa and Mona, so...
c402_10_true1	The power of Lux Sanctus is hard to regulate.\I must try harder to control it.
c402_10_true2	What I want...is the power to protect.\To protect my family, friends, and all who are dear to me!
c402_10_true3	I'm not a doll. I'm me.\I will fight as Noel Vermillion to the very end.
c402_10_victory	You're no match for me.
c402_boss_long	Now, please calm down.
c402_boss_short	Lieutenant Noel Vermillion mobilizing!
c402_ctskill	Activating Overdrive!
c402_death_1	I'm...done.
c402_death_2	Makoto... Tsubaki... I'm sorry.

c402_prskill	Type II: Bloom Trigger
c402_skill	Type XI: Optic Barrel
c402_spa	I'm still in the midst of my investigation, and yet...
c402_startbt	Here I come... Arcus Diabolus!
c402_story1	Maybe your master relies on you all too much.\You should tell him to improve his attitude.\I'll help too.
c402_story2	Oh, no! Don't worry about it.\I've got it!\We should just look to see where he's gone!
c402_story3	Lisa has told me that you lack the proper self-consciousness as an Archfiend candidate. You have such wonderful aides like Lisa and Mona, so...
c402_true1	Oooh! It's Panda! Panda, Paaanda! ♪ \Wha?! Y-You saw me?
c402_true2	Ah! A bug?! I hate bugs! \They've got all those legs,\and the way they swarm around... Ugh, I'm done.
c402_true3	Dispatched in mankind's darkest hour, we are the knights of the blue flame.\Oh! Makotooo! You forgot it again, didn't you?!\Ugh, memorize it already, would you?
c402_victory	You're under arrest.
c403_boss_long	Tada! I'm ready! Now ring the gong!
c403_boss_short	Lemme warn you...! I don’t know how to pull my punches.
c403_ctskill	C'mon, try harder!
c403_death_1	I can’t...get back...up...!
c403_death_2	Aaaaaaugh!
c403_drive	Big Bang SMASH!
c403_hit_1	Wah!
c403_hit_2	Hold up, hold up!
c403_hit_3	That hurt!
c403_prskill	Sirius Jolt!
c403_skill	Impact!
c403_spa	A hot spring! Sweet!
c403_startbt	The heavens, the earth, and a million squirrels call to me! ...Huh? What? They don’t?
c403_story1	Aaah! The weather's so nice today!\There's not much wind so it's not cold either.\I've got that sandwich I bought, so I think I'll have lunch here.
c403_story2	Wow. This world may seem like the one I'm from, but it's completely different.\Just taking a stroll is a blast.\The food is amazing, and there's so much nature everywhere. It's pretty impressive.
c403_story3	They told me that these ears and tail are all a part of me, too. They accepted me for who I am.
c403_true1	Every day is a blast when I'm with Noel and Tsubaki!
c403_true2	Demons are amazing!\I don't really know what's amazing about them,\but they're just plain cool!
c403_true3	Dispatched in mankind's darkest hour, we are the knights of the blue flame. I did it! I said it! Noel! I said it right this time! Huh? That should be a no-brainer? Seriously?
c403_victory	This's the path I walk!
c404_boss_long	How dull.
c404_boss_short	What a yawn.
c404_ctskill	You're not getting away!
c404_death_1	You're kidding me...
c404_death_2	This can't be happening... It can't be...
c404_drive	Calamitous Burial by Azure Fire (Azurite...Inferno!)
c404_hit_1	Guh...
c404_hit_2	Impressive!
c404_hit_3	Not bad.
c404_prskill	Overwhelming Deep Blue Pressure (Navy Pressure)!
c404_skill	Roar of the Condemning Aster (Mauvette Roar)!
c404_spa	This doesn't compare to the humiliation I suffered.
c404_startbt	Do you need a handicap?
c404_story1	I'll see what you're capable of for myself.
c404_story2	You have nothing to blame but your own bad luck.
c404_story3	You should be honored to die at my hands.
c404_true1	This won't take long.\Let's get started.
c404_true2	Try not to bore me.
c404_true3	I'll burn you to such a crisp, there won't even be ash left!
c404_victory	You were just outclassed.
c405_88_boss_long	You are not fit for the crown.
c405_88_boss_short	You wish to test my spear?
c405_88_ctskill	For my king!
c405_88_death_1	I'm not...yet...broken...
c405_88_death_2	Aaah!
c405_88_drive	Would you give it a rest already?
c405_88_hit_1	A mere flesh wound.
c405_88_hit_2	I was careless.
c405_88_hit_3	Well well...
c405_88_hit_4	Ooof!
c405_88_hit_5	What?
c405_88_hit_6	I shall pay this back in full.
c405_88_hit_7	How tiresome.
c405_88_hit_8	Still lacking.
c405_88_hit_9	Gah!
c405_88_prskill	I know not the meaning of the word defeat!
c405_88_skill	Try to deflect this.
c405_89_boss_long	You are not fit for the crown.
c405_89_boss_short	You wish to test my spear?
c405_89_ctskill	For my king!
c405_89_death_1	I'm not...yet...broken...
c405_89_death_2	Aaah!
c405_89_drive	Would you give it a rest already?
c405_89_hit_1	A mere flesh wound.
c405_89_hit_2	I was careless.
c405_89_hit_3	Well well...
c405_89_hit_4	Ooof!
c405_89_hit_5	What?
c405_89_hit_6	I shall pay this back in full.
c405_89_hit_7	How tiresome.
c405_89_hit_8	Still lacking.
c405_89_hit_9	Gah!
c405_89_prskill	I know not the meaning of the word defeat!
c405_89_skill	Try to deflect this.
c405_boss_long	I am Luin.\Lance of Sir Rufus.
c405_boss_short	Awaiting orders, Sir Rufus.
c405_ctskill	For my king!
c405_death_1	I'm not...yet...broken...
c405_death_2	Aaah!
c405_drive	This is not your place!
c405_hit_1	Ooof!
c405_hit_2	I am disappointed in you.
c405_hit_3	Ooof!
c405_prskill	I will not admit defeat!
c405_skill	You must also know when to throw in the towel.
c405_spa	I suppose I must admit there was SOME merit in choosing to trust and follow you.
c405_startbt	You will put your all on the line.
c405_story1	The past is immutable.\It's like I'm standing still in times long past,\and I don't think I'll ever be able to escape.
c405_story2	It seems I disappointed you.\No matter.\I found my answer.
c405_story3	I intend to have no thoughts; to make no decisions.\I entrusted my path to him.\That was the final decision I made for myself.
c405_true1	I thought it was my destiny\to be alone for eternity and left to die.\Until I met him...
c405_true2	I will remain by his side and watch over him.\I cannot fully comprehend Sir Rufus's thoughts,\but I believe in him.
c405_true3	Escape has nothing to offer me.\I would only come face-to-face with my weakness.\I will keep moving forward.\What will you do?
c405_victory	I shall acknowledge you this time.
c406_boss_long	Meow! I won't lose!
c406_boss_short	Time to hunt!
c406_ctskill	Now!
c406_death_1	Oof, they got me good.
c406_death_2	Guess this is the end...of my journey...
c406_drive	Meooow!
c406_hit_1	Aaah!
c406_hit_2	Urgh!
c406_hit_3	Whoa!
c406_prskill	Okay! Here I go!
c406_skill	Meow meow meow!
c406_spa	Purrfect...
c406_startbt	I'm gonna do it, kay?
c406_story1	Gotcha! Now apologize, okay?
c406_story2	Meow... I can't do anything fancy.
c406_story3	Mmm, I guess there's no way around it.\Okay then, I'll give you a little break.
c406_true1	I wonder what Caracal's doing?
c406_true2	Humans are such nice Friends.
c406_true3	I wanna travel together again sometime!
c406_victory	Yaaay! We won!
c407_boss_long	This is a park crisis!
c407_boss_short	Treasure is calling me.
c407_ctskill	I dunno what's going on, but leave it to me!
c407_death_1	No way!
c407_death_2	I got done in...
c407_drive	I'm gonna seize the world!
c407_hit_1	Owww!
c407_hit_2	Waaah?!
c407_hit_3	Stop it!
c407_prskill	Gotcha!
c407_skill	Yaaa!
c407_spa	*sigh* Hot springs feel so nice.\Fennec should come too.
c407_startbt	Leave it to me!
c407_story1	What is this?! It's sweet and fluffy, but it vanished as soon as I put it in my mouth!
c407_story2	Fennec! Come catch clouds with me!
c407_story3	You try some too, Serval and Fennec!\It's white, sweet, fluffy, melty, and super good!
c407_true1	I may look like I'm washing my hands, like my name 'washing bear' suggests, but I'm really looking for food in the river!
c407_true2	But if everyone found out, they'd change my name to Fumble Bear, so don't tell anyone!
c407_true3	Where's Fennec?! She comes to help me only sometimes.
c407_victory	Our formation was invincible!
c408_boss_long	Ringtaaail, be carefuuul.
c408_boss_short	I told you, just take it easy.
c408_ctskill	Kaaay, here I go.
c408_death_1	I'm done for...
c408_death_2	Ringtail... The rest is up to you.
c408_drive	I'll do my best!
c408_hit_1	Gah...
c408_hit_2	Aaah!
c408_hit_3	Owww!
c408_prskill	Oooh, thought so!
c408_skill	Nice!
c408_spa	This is such a great place.
c408_startbt	Ringtaaail, stop rushing ahead!
c408_story1	Ugh, once you have an idea in your mind, you just won't let it go.
c408_story2	Clouds are way high up, so why don't we try going somewhere high, like a mountain?
c408_story3	Huh. Yeah, I can see why you thought this came from the clouds in the sky.
c408_true1	Remembering the locations of the stars and sun is fundamental.
c408_true2	My big ears help keep me cool.
c408_true3	Oh bother... Ringtail's done it again.
c408_victory	Thank you, thank you!
c409_10_boss_long	Don't treat me like a child!
c409_10_boss_short	You might get hooked on me now that I've become so grown up!
c409_10_ctskill	Here's a special gift from me. ♥
c409_10_death_1	But I can still fight!
c409_10_death_2	I'm just...a little hungry...
c409_10_drive	Have some donuts!
c409_10_hit_1	Huh?
c409_10_hit_2	Eeek!
c409_10_hit_3	You'll have to do better than that.
c409_10_prskill	I'll cram it all in your mouth.
c409_10_skill	Can I take a nice, big bite?
c409_10_spa	Let's splash around!
c409_10_startbt	Will you give me a reward when I win?
c409_10_story1	Mmm!\It'sh sho good!
c409_10_story2	This is for those tasty donuts you gave me ♥
c409_10_story3	I'm gonna fight.\Run, little kiddy Child!
c409_10_true1	If someone gives you donuts, they can't be that bad.\Maybe if I go with them, they'll give me more!
c409_10_true2	When you say donuts,\what do you think of? Cops!\They're so cool!\I'll help out, too!
c409_10_true3	From here on out, I...\I will fight by your side.
c409_10_victory	Reward me with donuts. ♥
c409_boss_long	I'm gonna tie this up and take a snack break ♥
c409_boss_short	Oooh!\There are so many I wanna eat! ♥
c409_ctskill	I'll let you have a bunch!
c409_death_1	Nooo, I don't like this...
c409_death_2	Aww. I hate this!
c409_drive	Room for dessert, activate!
c409_hit_1	Agh!
c409_hit_2	No!
c409_hit_3	Waaah...
c409_prskill	Let's have a donut party!
c409_skill	Here you go. Say "aaah!"
c409_spa	Let's splash around!
c409_startbt	Mmm!\So yummy ♥
c409_story1	Hee hee hee ♥\I just know you'll change your tune after you try it.\You'll discover the happiness donuts can bring ♥\
c409_story2	The moment Master gave me this donut,\I had an image of that little girl's eyes sparkling while she ate it,\her face lit up with joy.\
c409_story3	Don't be like that.\What better way is there to get closer to someone\than sharing something tasty?\Hee hee hee ♥
c409_true1	*homf* Mmm! This donut is so yummy ♥\Putting it down as a potential fated donut for Master.\I wanna have him try it as soon as possible.\Hee hee hee ♥
c409_true2	That girl looked super happy\when she ate the donut I left on her desk.\It looks like she really liked\her peach cream donut gift ♥
c409_true3	Hee hee ♥ Searching for your fated donut\is really just an excuse.\The truth is, the disgruntled face you make when I force-feed you\is so cute, I wanna keep doing it ♥
c409_victory	Ahhh, I'm so full ♥
c410_boss_long	Blah, blah, blah, loud mouth!
c410_boss_short	Oh, you're here.
c410_ctskill	Bring it!
c410_death_1	You got...really lucky...
c410_death_2	Urgh!
c410_drive	Wonder if you can beat me!
c410_hit_1	Was that supposed to be an attack?
c410_hit_2	Who are you picking a fight with?
c410_hit_3	Guh!
c410_prskill	And where do you think you can run?!
c410_skill	You're going down!
c410_spa	Did you think something like this would satisfy me?\Bring me some cold water.
c410_startbt	This is nothing!
c410_story1	Ooh,\here's an idea!\After I defeat her,\I'll sort everything out nice and neat!
c410_story2	I'm really gonna have to kill Rufus, aren't I?\*sigh*\What a pain.
c410_story3	Listen up.\Demons are destructive beings.\The end goal of deceiving humans\is to facilitate their destruction.
c410_true1	It must've been fate for us to meet like this.\Wanna have another fun little battle?\Hahaha! Did I scare you?\I was joking.
c410_true2	The Mortal Realm's not that fun, really.\You can't wage war every day like in the Infernal Realm.
c410_true3	Hey, how long are you gonna doubt me?\Just trust me already, will ya?\I'm gonna fight for you till the end.\So long as you're my Master.
c410_victory	That was a blast!
c412_88_boss_long	I command you by the blood of the martyr.
c412_88_boss_short	Have mercy, O Lord.
c412_88_bubble_prskill	Please pray for us.
c412_88_bubble_skill	Hear my prayer.
c412_88_ctskill	Please forgive me...
c412_88_death_1	Lord...the sinner returns...
c412_88_death_2	Mercy...
c412_88_drive	The most noble of persons commands...
c412_88_hit_1	As in the beginning...
c412_88_hit_2	Agh...
c412_88_hit_3	Goh...
c412_88_hit_4	Away with you!
c412_88_hit_5	Resorting to trickery...
c412_88_hit_6	Damn!
c412_88_hit_7	Forgive us.
c412_88_hit_8	Be gone, demon!
c412_88_hit_9	Why you...!
c412_88_prskill	Please pray for us.
c412_88_skill	Hear my prayer.
c412_89_boss_long	I command you by the blood of the martyr.
c412_89_boss_short	Have mercy, O Lord.
c412_89_bubble_prskill	Please pray for us.
c412_89_bubble_skill	Hear my prayer.
c412_89_ctskill	Please forgive me...
c412_89_death_1	Lord...the sinner returns...
c412_89_death_2	Mercy...
c412_89_drive	The most noble of persons commands...
c412_89_hit_1	As in the beginning...
c412_89_hit_2	Agh...
c412_89_hit_3	Goh...
c412_89_hit_4	Away with you!
c412_89_hit_5	Resorting to trickery...
c412_89_hit_6	Damn!
c412_89_hit_7	Forgive us.
c412_89_hit_8	Be gone, demon.
c412_89_hit_9	Why you...!
c412_89_prskill	Please pray for us.
c412_89_skill	Hear my prayer.
c412_boss_long	Lead my soul.
c412_boss_short	Have mercy.
c412_ctskill	Please forgive me...
c412_death_1	Lord...the sinner returns...
c412_death_2	Mercy...
c412_drive	I am become the Lord's envoy!
c412_hit_1	Right...
c412_hit_2	Gah...
c412_hit_3	Urgh!
c412_prskill	It is the Lord's command!
c412_skill	Heed the voice of the Lord!
c412_spa	Give me the courage to not be swayed\by Satan's snares.
c412_startbt	Lord, protect me.
c412_story1	Forgive us, O Lord.
c412_story2	Every creature in creation has a purpose.\If this is the Lord's will, then I will simply obey it.
c412_story3	It is time to right all wrongs.\Thus spoke the Lord,\"for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."
c412_true1	Abel, is that you?\Will you finally forgive me?\How peculiar. You should be dead.\Hmph. I seem to be having a bad dream.
c412_true2	Good morning, Abel.\I think it's going to be a long day today.\You always go overboard, after all.\Let me know if you ever find yourself in trouble.
c412_true3	Oh, Abel. I had the dream again...the usual one.\I killed you with my own hands. I survive...\And then I hear that person's voice.\It calls out to me, asking if at last I hear it.
c412_victory	Thank you, O Lord.
c414_10_boss_long	You're gonna run away after coming this far?!
c414_10_boss_short	Who is my opponent?
c414_10_ctskill	I am not done for yet!
c414_10_death_1	Hmph. You got lucky.
c414_10_death_2	Urgh...
c414_10_drive	You must have some rotten luck to cross paths with me!
c414_10_hit_1	Don't get too excited!
c414_10_hit_2	Damn!
c414_10_hit_3	Impossible!
c414_10_prskill	You're pretty good!
c414_10_skill	You're full of openings!
c414_10_spa	Ack, I'm no good\with really hot baths.
c414_10_startbt	Can you keep up?
c414_10_story1	I go wherever there's water!\To a hydro shooter, water is everything!
c414_10_story2	Lisa. I'm gonna give you a chance to reclaim your dignity.\No Annie this time.\Face me all on your own!
c414_10_story3	It's not so bad laying down your gun\and having some plain old fun every now and then!
c414_10_true1	Water gun battles are decided by skill.\If you wanna win, you can't count on serendipity.\All there is to do is fight.
c414_10_true2	Lisa?\Annie went as far as to give her a gun.\She's not an opponent I can take lightly.
c414_10_true3	You want to know why I do water gun battles?\To become a legend.\To inscribe my name into the annals of history.\That's all I want.
c414_10_victory	That battle was amazing!
c414_89_boss_long	You're challenging me? You're just a kid.
c414_89_boss_short	I've been waiting for this!
c414_89_ctskill	Hmph. Way to go overboard.
c414_89_death_1	Gunslingers...\don't show their backs...\even when they die...
c414_89_death_2	Urgh...
c414_89_drive	Shooters don't look back!
c414_89_hit_1	Gah!
c414_89_hit_2	Yikes!
c414_89_hit_3	Hahaha!
c414_89_hit_4	You brat!
c414_89_hit_5	That's interesting...
c414_89_hit_6	How could this...
c414_89_hit_7	You call that an attack?
c414_89_hit_8	You're pretty good!
c414_89_hit_9	Ugh!
c414_89_prskill	You dare look away from me?!
c414_89_skill	Let's see what you're made of!
c414_boss_long	You're gonna run away after coming this far?!
c414_boss_short	Who is my opponent?
c414_ctskill	Hmph. Way to go overboard.
c414_death_1	Gunslingers...\don't show their backs...\even when they die...
c414_death_2	Urgh...
c414_drive	The time for games has ended!
c414_hit_1	Ngh!
c414_hit_2	Kh!
c414_hit_3	You've made a grave mistake...
c414_prskill	My targets don't escape!
c414_skill	I'll handle this!
c414_spa	Water gun fights aren't allowed at hot springs.\Even a Hydro Shooter knows that.
c414_startbt	Take cover behind me!
c414_story1	I go wherever there's water!\To a hydro shooter, water is everything!
c414_story2	Lisa. I'm gonna give you a chance to reclaim your dignity.\No Annie this time.\Face me all on your own!
c414_story3	It's not so bad laying down your gun\and having some plain old fun every now and then!
c414_true1	Water gun battles are decided by skill.\If you wanna win, you can't count on serendipity.\All there is to do is fight.
c414_true2	Lisa?\Annie went as far as to give her a gun.\She's not an opponent I can take lightly.
c414_true3	You want to know why I do water gun battles?\To become a legend.\To inscribe my name into the annals of history.\That's all I want.
c414_victory	That battle was amazing!
c415_boss_long	Ya think ya got the skills to be my opponent?
c415_boss_short	Fast an' flawless!
c415_ctskill	Keep it cool!
c415_death_1	We ever meet again I'll...
c415_death_2	Urghhh...
c415_drive	This match is good as done.
c415_hit_1	Heh heh!
c415_hit_2	Ain't that funny.
c415_hit_3	Guh!
c415_prskill	It's all higgledy-piggledy.
c415_skill	Yer too big for yer britches.
c415_spa	Cool mountain streams are nice,\but lukewarm hot springs ain't bad either.
c415_startbt	Back me up!
c415_story1	It's clear yer heart's in the right place.\Ya got what it takes to wield the Spittin' Dragon!
c415_story2	Listen, I've taught ya all sorts o' things.\But ultimately, the water gun battle\is yers to fight.
c415_story3	It's too bad ya ain't game for water gun battles.\Good thing that ain't the only way\for us to have fun, though...
c415_true1	Could be said patience an' self-restraint\are the virtues of a hydro shooter.\In that sense, yer missin' the mark by far.
c415_true2	No such thing as an endless summer.\It's a shame, but them's the breaks.\Course, if ya wait it out,\a new summer rolls in before long.
c415_true3	Lisa an' Davi are my precious students.\Ours is a special connection.\I really 'preciate havin' met 'em on account o' ya.
c415_victory	Ya know ya owe me for that, right?
c416_10_boss_long	Don't run off now.
c416_10_boss_short	Your luck ran out when you ran into me!
c416_10_ctskill	Boo! Scared you, didn't I?
c416_10_death_1	Aw, man... I was stronger than before, too...
c416_10_death_2	Let's play again someday...
c416_10_drive	I'll send you down the river Styx!
c416_10_hit_1	Oh, come on!
c416_10_hit_2	I'll have my revenge.
c416_10_hit_3	Ow...
c416_10_prskill	Psst, you should try to get away ASAP.
c416_10_skill	Aaahahaha!
c416_10_spa	Come here...\Let's get in together.\Forget about going home.
c416_10_startbt	Let's have ourselves a bout. What do you say?
c416_10_story1	You tell them but they don't get it.\Yeah, I know a dum-dum like that.
c416_10_story2	I know I'm one to talk\since I'm not even in the Archfiend Contest,\but I wouldn't call it losing\if you made it out alive.
c416_10_story3	A demon lost his virginity with the help of an exorcist...\This is a horror story, isn't it?
c416_10_true1	A shame. Wasn't very bright but still, a sweet demon nonetheless.\I'm glad Kanaloa didn't like water guns.
c416_10_true2	I thought you died...\Glad I was wrong.
c416_10_true3	It's been peaceful, but so boring day in and day out.\I'm having a blast now, though.
c416_10_victory	Isn't it way more fun than water gun battles?!
c416_87_boss_long	Do I seem all that strong?\Don't be scared.
c416_87_boss_short	Be brave!
c416_87_bubble_prskill	I'll let you see the real me.
c416_87_bubble_skill	You can be a ghost soon...\Heh heh heh.
c416_87_ctskill	Boo! Scared you, didn't I?
c416_87_death_1	Aw, man... I was stronger than before, too...
c416_87_death_2	Let's play again someday...
c416_87_drive	What should I write on your tombstone?
c416_87_hit_1	Ngh!
c416_87_hit_2	Oof...
c416_87_hit_3	Still fighting back?
c416_87_hit_4	Eh heh heh...
c416_87_hit_5	Had enough?
c416_87_hit_6	Ack...
c416_87_hit_7	Oh, jeez.
c416_87_hit_8	I thought I said that hurts.
c416_87_hit_9	Nooo!
c416_87_prskill	I'll let you see the real me.
c416_87_skill	What should I write on your tombstone?
c416_boss_long	Have you ever seen a Will o'the Wisp?
c416_boss_short	Outta luck, aren't ya?
c416_ctskill	Did I scare you?\Hee hee!
c416_death_1	Dying isn't the end...\You know that, right?
c416_death_2	Hee hee hee!
c416_drive	I wanna hear you scream.
c416_hit_1	Urgh!
c416_hit_2	Hngh!
c416_hit_3	Waaagh! Ack!
c416_prskill	You won't get away!
c416_skill	Shhh. Be quiet.
c416_spa	Oh yeah. This is a secret, but...\I'll tell you anyway.\That lady's been staring at you\this whole time.
c416_startbt	Did you hear something weird just now?
c416_story1	Ugh. They're so annoying.\Why did I have to be born into a family\with sisters like those?
c416_story2	I thought life here would be pretty easy.\But it turns out living here while having to take care of them—\by the way, they have no clue how things here work—\has been tougher than I ever imagined.
c416_story3	Normally, only people who are easily scared fall for ghosts' pranks,\but I guess you fall into that category.
c416_true1	Aren't water gun battles super childish?\It's way more fun\freaking out scaredy cats.\Hee hee!
c416_true2	Did you know? They say it brings you good luck\to wear seven cat hairs.\Come to think of it, aren't you descended from a cat?\Hee hee! You better watch your back!
c416_true3	You shouldn't ignore the existence of the soul.\Dying doesn't mean it's the end.\You should've met them by now.\Am I right?
c416_victory	Whaaat?\I can't believe it's over already.
c417_10_boss_long	Even us foxes love playing in the water.
c417_10_boss_short	I love cool shade!
c417_10_ctskill	Too slow.
c417_10_death_1	How vexing!
c417_10_death_2	Oh... my love...
c417_10_drive	You'll pay for this with your life.
c417_10_hit_1	Ah!
c417_10_hit_2	Gah...
c417_10_hit_3	That hurt!
c417_10_prskill	Silence.
c417_10_skill	I'm back!
c417_10_spa	Hey now! Do NOT touch my tail without permission.
c417_10_startbt	I hate being hot!
c417_10_story1	Should I ever find someone I can love as truly and deeply\as I loved that man, I would devote myself to him utterly.\That happiness is what I'm searching for.
c417_10_story2	I have not the slightest interest\in men enthralled by false love.\The meat, however, is blameless.
c417_10_story3	Hmm,\in that light, I have done him quite a disservice.\And after what we have been through together,\perhaps it is best not to cause too much trouble...
c417_10_true1	You said you'd take care of me. You can't even buy me\ten servings of meat. You should be ashamed of yourself!
c417_10_true2	Can I ever fall in love\again? I'm not sure...
c417_10_true3	I tried to keep my promise.\Meat helps me forget the past.
c417_10_victory	That hit the spot!
c417_89_boss_long	The feeling of losing someone you love...\I bet you know it not!
c417_89_boss_short	Oh...my love...
c417_89_ctskill	You shall know anguish.
c417_89_death_1	Ahh... In the end, there is only one person I love...
c417_89_death_2	With this...I can go by your side...
c417_89_drive	Suffer my grudge!
c417_89_hit_1	Ouch!
c417_89_hit_2	Urgh...
c417_89_hit_3	Heh. You make me laugh.
c417_89_hit_4	What do you think you are touching?!
c417_89_hit_5	Do not touch my tails!
c417_89_hit_6	Why, you...!
c417_89_hit_7	Urgh!
c417_89_hit_8	Oho...that was a surprise.
c417_89_hit_9	Insolence!
c417_89_prskill	I despise you!
c417_89_skill	I wonder. Can the likes of you withstand this?
c417_boss_long	I... I am seeking new love.
c417_boss_short	I shall show you what hell truly looks like.
c417_ctskill	Take this.
c417_death_1	Oh, how vexing...
c417_death_2	Ahh... I may finally...see the man I loved...
c417_drive	You cannot escape me.
c417_hit_1	Hrm!
c417_hit_2	What? Did you touch me just now?
c417_hit_3	That tickled.
c417_prskill	Let me see. We shall play with my tails.
c417_skill	I wonder. Can the likes of you withstand this?
c417_spa	Hey now! Do NOT touch my tail without permission.
c417_startbt	You may run to the ends of the earth, but you cannot run from me.
c417_story1	Should I ever find someone I can love as truly and deeply\as I loved that man, I would devote myself to him utterly.\That happiness is what I'm searching for.
c417_story2	I have not the slightest interest\in men enthralled by false love.\The meat, however, is blameless. ♥
c417_story3	Hmm,\in that light, I have done him quite a disservice.\And after what we have been through together,\perhaps it is best not to cause too much trouble...
c417_true1	Finding new love.\It is not quite so easy.
c417_true2	Are all modern meat dishes like that?!\So juicy, and the texture... Ahhh, I want my new lover to be a man\who can feed me lots of meat!
c417_true3	Being poor means you cannot afford to buy me a lot of meat.\And yet, the meat you grill me has such an exceptional flavor.\Hmph. I would not be against you becoming my new lover.
c417_victory	Now, the loser shall give me meat!
c418_boss_long	I shall bring the hammer of justice down upon all who commit crimes.
c418_boss_short	Are you my opponent?\Interesting...
c418_ctskill	Evil will not be forgiven!
c418_death_1	Ahh...\I wanted to be by your side...a little longer...
c418_death_2	I couldn't fulfill my duty...\Forgive me...
c418_drive	I'm pulling out all the stops!
c418_hit_1	Gah...
c418_hit_2	Guh...
c418_hit_3	Insolence!
c418_prskill	I will show you true justice!
c418_skill	Stop this if you can!
c418_spa	Ahhh... This is a very...relaxing place.
c418_startbt	I'll show you what a real fight looks like!
c418_story1	What's happening to me lately?\I didn't use to be like this.
c418_story2	I didn't know a thing about her to begin with.\But then I saw her for what should've been my first time,\and I felt this urge to protect her.
c418_story3	Let this be a warning to all the vermin crawling around these parts!\I won't let a single one of you get away\with causing Tamamo grief!
c418_true1	Since fusing with the bow,\my heart has gone through changes I couldn't have foreseen.\I have no choice but to accept this.
c418_true2	In this world, far too many approach you\with wickedness in their hearts.\I've got no choice but to protect you.
c418_true3	I intend to be by your side always.\I'll protect you from any and all dangers.\That is why I tell you to trust in me.
c418_victory	It couldn't have gone any other way.
c419_boss_long	So... How do you feel about me...?
c419_boss_short	You like her more than me?
c419_ctskill	You're gonna make me say it?
c419_death_1	*sob* Waaah...
c419_death_2	Liar.
c419_drive	Last night was...amazing.
c419_hit_1	Fine by me.
c419_hit_2	Ngh...
c419_hit_3	Hrgh!
c419_prskill	You're so kinky...
c419_skill	...You must like what you see.
c419_spa	Uh... Would you mind not staring at me like that? It's kinda creepy...
c419_startbt	Welcome.
c419_story1	I'm not going to ask you about the past. It doesn't matter.
c419_story2	But from now on... If you ever cheat on me...I'll be angry.
c419_story3	As long as I'm first, you can keep doing what you want with her. Everything'll remain the same between us.
c419_true1	Marriage is just a "tradition," right? Seriously, who wants to be tied down?
c419_true2	Listen... I came here because I like you.
c419_true3	What do you mean? That's normal, isn't it? You can live however you want, too... Just so long as you never think of cheating on me...
c419_victory	Hehe, thanks...
c420_10_boss_long	H-Hey... Are you serious...?
c420_10_boss_short	Don't be stupid.
c420_10_ctskill	What...? Geez.
c420_10_death_1	No... That can't be true...
c420_10_death_2	*sigh*
c420_10_drive	See you next time.
c420_10_hit_1	*sigh*
c420_10_hit_2	...
c420_10_hit_3	Oh, ew.
c420_10_prskill	I cannot believe this.
c420_10_skill	Wha--?!
c420_10_spa	There something you want to tell me?
c420_10_startbt	Don't hold anything back.
c420_10_story1	...Am I really that undesirable to you?
c420_10_story2	Guess I was mistaken.
c420_10_story3	Sorry. I have plans.
c420_10_true1	You know, I always felt tied down.
c420_10_true2	It's better for people to be free.
c420_10_true3	Maybe we got too comfortable.
c420_10_victory	That takes care of that.
c420_89_boss_long	Hey, I want to talk to you about something.
c420_89_boss_short	Still waking up?
c420_89_bubble_prskill	There's no way I'd forgive you!
c420_89_bubble_skill	You're the worst!
c420_89_drive	Do you know what Full Body is?
c420_89_hit_1	This can't be right!
c420_89_hit_2	You're crazy!
c420_89_hit_3	Why me?!
c420_89_hit_4	Is that right?
c420_89_hit_5	Don't just say whatever comes to mind!
c420_89_hit_6	Listen, you...
c420_89_hit_7	Oh, I'm perfectly calm.
c420_89_hit_8	Oh, ew.
c420_89_hit_9	What is it?
c420_89_prskill	There's no way I'd forgive you!
c420_89_skill	You're the worst!
c420_boss_long	So everything's fine because you got another girl?
c420_boss_short	You enjoyed that fling, didn't you?
c420_ctskill	What exactly have I got wrong?!
c420_death_1	Help!
c420_death_2	Aaagh!
c420_drive	...I think I'm pregnant.
c420_hit_1	What is it?
c420_hit_2	Huh.
c420_hit_3	Get out of the way!
c420_prskill	You're the worst!
c420_skill	I...I'm sorry.
c420_spa	Ah, I feel so refreshed.
c420_startbt	I'm going ahead!
c420_story1	So you're happy... That's good to hear.
c420_story2	Oh, but I plan to go back to work after having the baby.\ We'll just have to split up the housework, okay?\You can't throw your clothes everywhere anymore!
c420_story3	Oh, right.\You've got to quit smoking, too.\It's not good for this child.
c420_true1	I mean, it's easy to keep things like they are now, but...
c420_true2	Not that, your phone! Did you get another one!?
c420_true3	To be honest, I was a little worried. It's so hard to tell what you're thinking sometimes...
c420_victory	You messed with the wrong person.
c421_boss_long	Uh, um!
c421_boss_short	Good morning.
c421_ctskill	Move, please!
c421_death_1	Zzz... Zzz...
c421_death_2	Well, I'll see you later…
c421_drive	I'll try to practice real hard!
c421_hit_1	Gah!
c421_hit_2	Don't worry. It's nothing.
c421_hit_3	Oh!
c421_prskill	I'll help you!
c421_skill	Yes!
c421_spa	Hmmm-hmmm ♪
c421_startbt	Ah! Help me!
c421_story1	My music calms my heart. Even in a place like this. I'd like to share that feeling with everyone else...
c421_story2	Um... Is it a big deal? I guess I never thought about it that much. As long as you love each other...that's all that matters, isn't it?
c421_story3	It's okay. Know that I'll always be there for you.
c421_true1	I was hoping to play a little better than that, but...
c421_true2	Excuse me...but are you in charge of how other people live their lives?
c421_true3	I knew you had a girlfriend, so...\I tried to hide my feelings from you.
c421_victory	Success.
c422_88_boss_long	Be gentle with me, please. ♥
c422_88_boss_short	Oh good, I was so tired of waiting.

c422_hit_1	Urgh!
c422_hit_2	Ahhh!
c422_hit_3	Take it easy on me!
c422_prskill	Do you want some love?
c422_skill	Muah. ♥
c422_spa	You're so funny, my little demon.\You sure go out of your way to score points with me\considering you supposedly can't stand me.
c422_startbt	Let me handle this. ♥
c422_story1	Seeing is believing!\Let's try taking this head on!
c422_story2	I thought you just kinda liked her.\But this? I don't stand a chance.
c422_story3	*sigh*\I used to think love was just a means to an end.
c422_true1	Why are you such a prude?\Where's your carnal instinct?\Don't you know you need it for your species to prosper?
c422_true2	With kids, the more the merrier, right?\Come here. Don't be shy. ♥
c422_true3	It doesn't matter to me how much of a pariah you are, little demon.\That's never been an issue.
c422_victory	You do understand that was thanks to me, yes?
c423_10_boss_long	Oh, darling... I miss you.

c423_10_hit_3	Please, just...
c423_10_prskill	If I win, I'll go ahead and devour you.
c423_10_skill	It hurts when I do this, doesn't it?
c423_10_spa	I'd like to come here with my darling.
c423_10_startbt	If only I could wake up from this dream.
c423_10_story1	*sigh*\Where could my darling have gone?
c423_10_story2	My darling...\I'm so happy...\I'm never ever leaving your side.
c423_10_story3	Please, take everything but my life...\I just want to see my darling one more time.
c423_10_true1	I might go crazy if I don't get to see my darling.
c423_10_true2	*sigh*\I'm overjoyed I got to wed my darling.
c423_10_true3	I'm scared...\It was just a dream,\so why am I so terrified?

c423_88_bubble_skill	How's this?!
c423_88_ctskill	Here goes!
c423_88_death_1	I wanted to snuggle my darling's clothes a while longer...
c423_88_death_2	Urgh...\Place my darling's clothes...\on my grave...\urgh...
c423_88_drive	I'll pay you back two-fold!
c423_88_hit_1	Ow!

c423_88_hit_5	Enough of this!
c423_88_hit_6	Revenge will be mine!
c423_88_hit_7	Unacceptable!
c423_88_hit_8	*sniffle*... The pain...

c423_88_prskill	This'll hurt a little. Heh heh heh.

c423_boss_short	Just how weak are you, exactly?
c423_ctskill	Here goes!
c423_death_1	I wanted to snuggle my darling's clothes a while longer...
c423_death_2	Urgh...\Place my darling's clothes...\on my grave...\urgh...
c423_drive	I will let you bear witness to my power!
c423_hit_1	Ouch!

c423_true1	*sigh*\How am I supposed to get my fill\of snuggling and nuzzling my darling's clothes without being caught?
c423_true2	I want to grow closer to my darling.\I can't be satisfied\with nothing but his clothing forever!
c423_true3	Say, darling... We're all but husband and wife at this point,\wouldn't you say?\There are oh so many things only a married couple can do. ♥

c425_story1	May our merciful Lord grant you eternal rest.\May eternal light shine on them, o' Lord.
c425_story2	But I know\that my Savior lives.
c425_story3	I wanted to dedicate you to Him, but...\I was overambitious.
c425_true1	I only exist for Him. When the time comes,\I will offer myself unto the Lord and disappear into the inferno.
c425_true2	I risked my life to carry out your holy work...\My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
c425_true3	I am blind. The Lord guides me,\but I cannot see the light. Everywhere I'm entombed in darkness.
c425_victory	Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
c426_00_boss_long	I'll give it my all.
c426_00_boss_short	I've got this!
c426_00_ctskill	She who strikes first wins!
c426_00_death_1	Maybe I was overambitious...
c426_00_death_2	Aww... I'm exhausted...
c426_00_drive	I'll get it on my first try!
c426_00_hit_1	Ow!
c426_00_hit_2	Oh no!
c426_00_hit_3	That hurts!
c426_00_prskill	I'll do this right!
c426_00_skill	I can't lose!
c426_00_spa	Excuse me? I thought I'd bathe alone... No?
c426_00_startbt	If I have to fight...!
c426_00_story1	I can't fall behind or let anyone stop me!
c426_00_story2	Is our relationship deepening? \Then, will we have children together?
c426_00_story3	Anything other than No. 1 is meaningless.
c426_00_true1	I became someone who couldn't do anything right on the first try.\No matter how hard I tried...
c426_00_true2	When you told me I was brave, I was no longer ashamed\of having to do things twice. Thank you.
c426_00_true3	I think that's when I fell for you. You accepted\me for who I was. I don't care if you're a demon. I really like you.
c426_00_victory	I did it!
c426_boss_long	We all know how this will end. Do I really need to fight?
c426_boss_short	Think you can beat me?
c426_ctskill	Mine!
c426_death_1	Oh, no...
c426_death_2	No way!
c426_drive	Let's get this over with!
c426_hit_1	That's it?
c426_hit_2	Heh?
c426_hit_3	Ahh!
c426_prskill	Pathfinder is my middle name!
c426_skill	Here I come!
c426_spa	I'm not interested in taking a break.
c426_startbt	It's obvious we're going to win. Let's get this over with!
c426_story1	I'm not going to fall behind. Nothing can stop me!
c426_story2	Am I right in thinking this is going somewhere?\We're going to have kids, right?
c426_story3	If you're not going to be No. 1, there's no point.
c426_true1	Master, your shoe soles are wearing thin. Sorry,\it's all my fault you couldn't get those sneakers. But please don't call off our wedding. Okay?
c426_true2	Ambrosia said you're a kind person.\Do you plan to become the Archfiend by attracting girls like this?
c426_true3	My pactmaker was made fun of\because she couldn't get things right the first time. I don't know what that's like, having always been first at everything.
c426_victory	Ah, I won. Again.
c428_88_boss_long	Humbly welcome the Lord.

c428_spa	The day is coming, when even the song of birds carried\on the winds will cease to be.
c428_startbt	Who dares defy the Lord?

c428_victory	Declare God victorious.
c429_88_boss_long	Do you have need of my aid?
c429_88_boss_short	This, too, must be our destiny.
c429_88_bubble_prskill	I have no regrets.
c429_88_bubble_skill	Pardon me.
c429_88_ctskill	I see the way we think is quite different.
c429_88_death_1	I didn't think it would come to this.
c429_88_death_2	I wonder if he'll be mad at me.
c429_88_drive	If that is your will...
c429_88_hit_1	How careless.
c429_88_hit_2	Aaah.
c429_88_hit_3	*sigh*
c429_88_hit_4	Please don't do this.
c429_88_hit_5	I can take it.
c429_88_hit_6	It'll all be over soon.
c429_88_hit_7	Aaah!
c429_88_hit_8	Ooof!
c429_88_hit_9	Ngh!
c429_88_prskill	Am I doing it right?
c429_88_skill	I'm sorry.
c429_boss_long	Do you have need of my aid?
c429_boss_short	This, too, must be our destiny.
c429_ctskill	I see the way we think is quite different.
c429_death_1	I didn't think it would come to this.
c429_death_2	I wonder if he'll be mad at me.
c429_drive	If that is your will!
c429_hit_1	How careless.
c429_hit_2	Aaah!
c429_hit_3	*sigh*
c429_prskill	Am I doing it right?
c429_skill	I'm sorry.
c429_spa	Please keep this a secret from Flins.\I need to spend time by myself every once in a while.
c429_startbt	I heard your voice.
c429_story1	I like it here.\I want to stay here with you\as long as we can.
c429_story2	I hadn't.\But I am glad you did.
c429_story3	Hm.\Perhaps it's because the cut was so deep,\but I'm finding it a little hard to accept your apology.
c429_true1	You seem under the weather.\I have a medicine that might liven your spirits. Would you like it?
c429_true2	Flins is the only one\who treats me like I'm special.\I'm truly grateful that I met him.
c429_true3	Stubbornness is a weakness of Flins's, but it's all right.\I love him so much it doesn't bother me.
c429_victory	Did I overdo it?
c430_boss_long	All ready to start running?
c430_boss_short	Capture!
c430_ctskill	About time I went on the offensive, eh?
c430_death_1	You won't...get away next time...
c430_death_2	What is even...happening?
c430_drive	Let's end this little game of tag!
c430_hit_1	Got some bite in you.
c430_hit_2	What do you think you're doing?
c430_hit_3	Ugh!
c430_prskill	Don't ignore me!
c430_skill	You can't get away.
c430_spa	Did I SAY I wanted to come to a place like this?\...I mean,\not like it's especially terrible or anything.
c430_startbt	Yeah, get in line.
c430_story1	Don't resent me when I kill you.\You were fated to fall into my hands eventually.
c430_story2	You don't know?\I guess they don't teach you that in the Mortal Realm.
c430_story3	But I can't do that forever,\now can I?
c430_true1	Gotta be really careful when you use a decoy.\You have to understand your opponent\to pick the right kind.
c430_true2	Were you hiding here?\Hehehe, did you think I wouldn't find you?\Give up.\I've got you right in the palm of my hand.
c430_true3	Ziva said you're a great demon,\but I just don't see it.\So, don't mind if I keep an eye on you for a while.
c430_victory	What I hunt belongs to me, right?
c431_boss_long	Skier of the snowy fields, Eshu, has arrived! I'm just messin'.
c431_boss_short	It's like all the beginners lined up.
c431_ctskill	I'll be the dealer this time.
c431_death_1	Ack, how could I mess up...?
c431_death_2	Ngh... Let's do this again...sometime...
c431_drive	You think you can stop this rush?
c431_hit_1	Ow!
c431_hit_2	Oh, please!
c431_hit_3	So rude!
c431_prskill	Wow, you're bad at this.
c431_skill	Just drew a good card!
c431_spa	This place always rules.
c431_startbt	Might as well enjoy a game every now and then!
c431_story1	I don't even know how to react.\I'm speechless. Hah!\That is so ridiculous that I don't even know what to say.
c431_story2	Aw, c'mon. You can do it.\As with all things, you just have to give it a good shot!\You wouldn't want all your efforts so far to go to waste!
c431_story3	So, you're a do or die kinda guy, huh?\If you can pull this off,\it might actually be pretty fun for both of us!
c431_true1	Eh, I think you're a pretty good demon overall,\but physically and emotionally, you're weaksauce.\You gotta pluck up some courage.
c431_true2	It's not exactly a secret,\but I kinda love skiing!\The feeling of gliding down the slope at top speed—\isn't it the best?!
c431_true3	If I ever get the chance,\I wanna try skiing down from the top of Mt. Everest!\Think of the adrenaline rush!
c431_victory	Challenge me whenever!
c432_boss_long	What to do? Should I go easy on you?
c432_boss_short	Do you want me to go easy on you?
c432_ctskill	Think you can dodge this?
c432_death_1	You... I'm going to kill you...
c432_death_2	I'll make you pay for this.
c432_drive	You should be honored.
c432_hit_1	That tickles.
c432_hit_2	Foolish!
c432_hit_3	You're kidding, right?
c432_prskill	This is going to hurt. Hoho.
c432_skill	Could you step aside?
c432_spa	Are you trying to impress me?\How pathetic.
c432_startbt	I'll be nice.
c432_story1	It's in everyone's nature to submit to those who are stronger than them? Screw you.\You can never tame me.
c432_story2	Humans are such conflicted animals.\They act as if they're okay, no matter how deeply wounded they are on the inside.
c432_story3	He can't tame me.\Even if he blindfolds me, shackles my limbs, and clips my wings.
c432_true1	Hello.\I'm your new Child, Artemis.
c432_true2	Please try not to annoy me.\I don't have much patience.
c432_true3	I've always been alone, but I don't blame anyone but myself.\I tend to destroy everything around me.
c432_victory	Don't be so melodramatic.
c433_10_boss_long	Don't blame me if you fall for me in this swimsuit.
c433_10_boss_short	Have we met somewhere?
c433_10_ctskill	What are you looking at?!
c433_10_death_1	You'll be sorry...
c433_10_death_2	Waaah...\It hurts...
c433_10_drive	I'm gonna give you the sweetest summer.
c433_10_hit_1	Aaahhh!
c433_10_hit_2	What was that?
c433_10_hit_3	Waaagh!
c433_10_prskill	I'm over here, you know.
c433_10_skill	Don't leave me on my own!
c433_10_spa	Wh-Wh-Who said it was okay to sneak a peek?\You little perv.\Seriously...
c433_10_startbt	Want to try some chocolate?
c433_10_story1	Tee hee!\I went and got a swimsuit\with the money I saved up from my part-time job.
c433_10_story2	I feel like we met somewhere before...\But I just can't remember.
c433_10_story3	It's not like I wanted to forget.\I was forced to do so.
c433_10_true1	A sports festival under the blazing midsummer sun?\Something doesn't feel quite right, but it does sound fun.
c433_10_true2	I just can't remember you.\Am I getting old?!
c433_10_true3	At last, I remember you.\I'd forgotten the most important person in the world to me.
c433_10_victory	Won't you play in the water with me?
c433_boss_long	Tee hee!\Stop pretending and give in!
c433_boss_short	It's me, Pakhet, the cutest little cutie-patootie. ♥
c433_ctskill	This is gonna hurt, but hang in there!
c433_death_1	I hate this...\Waaah!
c433_death_2	I'll get you for this.\*sniff*
c433_drive	Come with me!
c433_hit_1	So scary!
c433_hit_2	Yawn!
c433_hit_3	Ouch!
c433_prskill	I'll save you, Chief!
c433_skill	Quit ignoring me!
c433_spa	Wh-Wh-Who said it was okay to sneak a peek?\You little perv.\Seriously...
c433_startbt	You're gonna need some help!
c433_story1	He could buy me some flowers 'cause they're cute,\like me, and then kneel down and offer them to me!
c433_story2	Ooh, you'll see!\You're gonna love me yet!
c433_story3	Oh, no no no!\Don't talk about other girls in front of me!
c433_true1	Are you trying to run off again, Chief?!\Tee hee, no I get it.\I'm so cute you can't even deal with it.\Oh, you! Can you be any more adorable? ♥
c433_true2	If only you'd just tell me how you really feel...\What do you mean in what way?\Obviously, that you... That you lo...\Eee, never mind!
c433_true3	I don't even want to picture us being apart.\You'll stay beside me forever, right?
c433_victory	Did you see me, Chief?!
c434_boss_long	What an honor it must be to meet me.
c434_boss_short	Do you want to be my servant?
c434_ctskill	Worship me!
c434_death_1	Ngh... You best remember me!
c434_death_2	Argh!\You'll pay for this!
c434_drive	You think you can outdo my beauty?!
c434_hit_1	Aaah!
c434_hit_2	Aaah!
c434_hit_3	Ow!
c434_prskill	How utterly rude.
c434_skill	Kneel before me!
c434_spa	So nice and warm...\The water is just right.
c434_startbt	You can't resist my allure, can you?
c434_story1	Ugh, they're all useless! Useless, I say!
c434_story2	Phew.\He is a very lacking servant, that one,\but I'll let him off the hook.
c434_story3	I'm sorry!\I always thought you were just some kid!
c434_true1	What are you looking at?!\And what are you scheming?!
c434_true2	A servant ought to act like one!\That's what best suits you!
c434_true3	Devote yourself completely to me!\You just might be rewarded someday.
c434_victory	I'm expecting more gratitude than that!
c435_10_boss_long	For Serket!
c435_10_boss_short	Keep your hands to yourself!
c435_10_ctskill	This is how I feel!
c435_10_death_1	I have to protect...Serket...
c435_10_death_2	Serket...I'm sorry...
c435_10_drive	Don't you lay a hand on my sister!
c435_10_hit_1	How rude!
c435_10_hit_2	Oof!
c435_10_hit_3	How dare you!
c435_10_prskill	You're gonna make me mad.
c435_10_skill	Oh, so sweet.
c435_10_spa	Don't just stand there watching.\Let's enjoy it together!
c435_10_startbt	I'll keep Serket safe!
c435_10_story1	Th-These are...gifts!\I thought I'd pass out my\homemade candy to everyone.
c435_10_story2	I have a niiice, sweet dessert for you.\Please eat up!
c435_10_story3	I'm joking.\I know not to do something like that.\Anyway, how long have you been in love with her?
c435_10_true1	Serket's family, isn't she?\That's why I have this present for her:\my homemade candy!
c435_10_true2	You're not jealous\because I only ever spoil my little sister, are you?\I love both Serket AND you!
c435_10_true3	I'd do anything to keep Serket safe.\After all, we're family.
c435_10_victory	I said I'd keep her safe, didn't I?
c435_boss_long	What's your favorite flavor?
c435_boss_short	Please, don't get mad.
c435_ctskill	I can do it, too!
c435_death_1	Ngh, I'm dying...
c435_death_2	Aaaghhh!
c435_drive	Do you know true love?
c435_hit_1	So mean!
c435_hit_2	Take it easy on me.
c435_hit_3	Help me!
c435_prskill	Nothing to it.
c435_skill	Gyaha!
c435_spa	Would you mind not staring at me?\Let's have some candy together.
c435_startbt	I was wanting to see you, Mr. Demon.
c435_story1	Th-These are...gifts!\I thought I'd pass out my\homemade candy to everyone.
c435_story2	I have a niiice, sweet dessert for you.\Please eat up!
c435_story3	I'm joking.\I know not to do something like that.\Anyway, how long have you been in love with her?
c435_true1	Won't you have some of the candy I made?\It's definitely, completely normal candy.
c435_true2	I don't get people who fall in love.\Why do they daydream like that?
c435_true3	I wonder if I'll ever understand love,\even without love potions...\I hope when the time comes, I have someone to be with.
c435_victory	Well done, Mr. Demon.
c436_10_boss_long	Don't touch my sister!
c436_10_boss_short	Don't even go near her.
c436_10_ctskill	I love you, Sis!
c436_10_death_1	Sis, I'm...going on ahead...
c436_10_death_2	I gotta protect...Sytry...
c436_10_drive	I'll never let you go!
c436_10_hit_1	Owwie...
c436_10_hit_2	You're just the worst!
c436_10_hit_3	I've had it!
c436_10_prskill	Do not interfere!
c436_10_skill	I'm done dealing with you.
c436_10_spa	*yawn*\I feel like I might pass out.\This place is so peaceful.
c436_10_startbt	We'll always be together, Sis!
c436_10_story1	(Sis...\I want to make sure she's happy.\Because to me, she's...)
c436_10_story2	Tell me what you really want.\I'll be fine,\no matter what you say.
c436_10_story3	And I'm plenty happy\just being near you.
c436_10_true1	Sis, so pretty and sweet.\I love you.
c436_10_true2	Do you like me, Sis?\I love you.\I would do anything for you.
c436_10_true3	If anything were to happen to you, I would risk my life to protect you.\You're all I have.
c436_10_victory	It's over, sis!
c436_boss_long	Well, this is one way to meet.
c436_boss_short	Have you seen my sister?
c436_ctskill	Could you go away?
c436_death_1	I can't believe...this is happening!
c436_death_2	I'm so...so tired...
c436_drive	Together forever!
c436_hit_1	That's a bit much!
c436_hit_2	Ugh...
c436_hit_3	That hurts!
c436_prskill	This one's for Sytry!
c436_skill	No problem.
c436_spa	*yawn*\I feel like I might pass out.\This place is so peaceful.
c436_startbt	Come along with me.
c436_story1	(Sis...\I want to make sure she's happy.\Because to me, she's...)
c436_story2	Tell me what you really want.\I'll be fine,\no matter what you say.
c436_story3	And I'm plenty happy\just being near you.
c436_true1	I was in total darkness before I was reborn.\Since meeting Sytry, though,\my world's been as bright as can be...\She's all I have.
c436_true2	Sytry smells so good,\it almost makes my head spin.\Heehee, don't tell her though.
c436_true3	I don't have any memories from before,\but it doesn't bother me.\I'm gonna make tons of new ones with my sister from now on.
c436_victory	This would make Sytry happy, right?
c437_boss_long	Temper, temper!
c437_boss_short	Hehe. You want some chocolate?
c437_ctskill	Want another one?
c437_death_1	No more chocolates for you!
c437_death_2	This is it...for me...
c437_drive	Do you like chocolate?
c437_hit_1	Waaah!
c437_hit_2	Owwie!
c437_hit_3	Hey!
c437_prskill	Is it my turn?
c437_skill	It's tasty, isn't it?
c437_spa	*yawn*\It's so warm.\I could melt away.\Hehe...
c437_startbt	Oh, I can't bear to look!
c437_story1	Nooo!\It's smashed to bits!\
c437_story2	Why is this so hard?\I just want to let him know how I feel.
c437_story3	I've always wanted to tell you...\how I feel.
c437_true1	Chocolate is sweet, but also slightly bitter.\People's hearts are the same.\They're complicated.
c437_true2	Hehe!\I'm really good at making chocolate!
c437_true3	I gotta make some yummy chocolates again today.\I wonder if everyone will eat them.
c437_victory	Hooray! I won!
c438_10_boss_long	Did you come to celebrate Semele's wedding?
c438_10_boss_short	You're earlier than I thought.
c438_10_ctskill	I'll take care of you.
c438_10_death_1	Please, stay here in my final moments...
c438_10_death_2	I love you...
c438_10_drive	Here comes the bride.
c438_10_hit_1	Stop being so clingy.
c438_10_hit_2	Not bad. Hah hah hah!
c438_10_hit_3	I've taken a liking to you.
c438_10_prskill	Are you curious about Loki?
c438_10_skill	Try harder!
c438_10_spa	This is good. I was exhausted.\Ahh... I'm going to have a good night's sleep tonight.
c438_10_startbt	You don't really trust me, do you?
c438_10_story1	Did you know?\Your blind love is what makes you so special.
c438_10_story2	I don't like you. Actually, I hate you.\I want to vomit when you draw near.
c438_10_story3	This side of me is only for you.\Besides, even if I forget myself, you won't. Right?
c438_10_true1	Hi. I'm Semele, a demon. Oh, you don't have to remember\my name. Only Loki's name matters.
c438_10_true2	Poor thing. You would have found enlightenment, too,\if you'd listened to Loki's gospel.
c438_10_true3	I can never forget the dance I danced with him...\With him... With that boy...
c438_10_victory	Loki, are you happy?
c438_11_boss_long	Are you here for me?
c438_11_boss_short	Have we met before?
c438_11_ctskill	Would you be quiet?
c438_11_death_1	Am I dying...again?
c438_11_death_2	Who...am I?
c438_11_drive	I hear voices.
c438_11_hit_1	Such a shame.
c438_11_hit_2	Go away!
c438_11_hit_3	You don't like me, do you?
c438_11_prskill	Please, don't forget me.
c438_11_skill	Don't expect much from me.
c438_11_spa	This is good. I was exhausted.\Ahh... I'm going to have a good night's sleep tonight.
c438_11_startbt	Do you need me?
c438_11_story1	Did you know?\Your blind love is what makes you so special.
c438_11_story2	I don't like you. Actually, I hate you.\I want to vomit when you're near me.
c438_11_story3	This side of me is only for you.\Besides, even if I forget myself, you won't. Right?
c438_11_true1	There's no "me." There's only the past I remember.\That's how you get to call me "Semele."
c438_11_true2	We were friends.\That's how you remember us, I see.
c438_11_true3	I want for nothing.\Sometimes I feel as if I'm missing something... But what?
c438_11_victory	I forgot something again.
c438_12_boss_long	Do you like fighting?
c438_12_boss_short	Can we get this over with already?
c438_12_ctskill	Begone!
c438_12_death_1	I knew this would happen.
c438_12_death_2	*sigh*
c438_12_drive	Whatever.
c438_12_hit_1	Urgh!
c438_12_hit_2	I'm not crying.
c438_12_hit_3	Aaah!
c438_12_prskill	I'm not lonely.
c438_12_skill	I want to run away...
c438_12_spa	This is good. I was exhausted.\Ahh... I'm going to have a good night's sleep tonight.
c438_12_startbt	What a hassle!
c438_12_story1	Did you know?\Your blind love is what makes you so special.
c438_12_story2	I don't like you. Actually, I hate you.\I want to vomit when you're near me.
c438_12_story3	This side of me is only for you.\Besides, even if I forget myself, you won't. Right?
c438_12_true1	Why do you keep bugging me?\If you're trying to anger me, you're failing miserably.
c438_12_true2	Being patient isn't hard. I'm weak.\Being patient is the only thing I'm good at.
c438_12_true3	In the end, everyone's alone but...\But Eve, why wouldn't you leave me alone?
c438_12_victory	We won, somehow.
c438_boss_long	Did you come to celebrate Semele's wedding?
c438_boss_short	You're earlier than I thought.
c438_ctskill	I'll take care of you.
c438_death_1	Please, stay here in my final moments...
c438_death_2	I love you...
c438_drive	Here comes the bride.

c438_story2	I don't like you. Actually, I hate you.\I want to vomit when you draw near.
c438_story3	This side of me is only for you.\Besides, even if I forget myself, you won't. Right?
c438_true1	Being Loki's bride means\that you get to share his glass, and only I can handle that.
c438_true2	No one but Loki can be the next Archfiend. He's the only one\who can embrace this world.
c438_true3	Don't you hear his voice?\Poor thing, you can't hear his sweet voice.
c438_victory	Loki, are you happy?
c439_boss_long	For Maestro.
c439_boss_short	Are you ready?
c439_ctskill	This way!
c439_death_1	I haven't had the chance...to say anything...
c439_death_2	Maestro...I'm sorry...
c439_drive	Please listen to how I feel!
c439_hit_1	Urgh...
c439_hit_2	Not yet.
c439_hit_3	One more time.
c439_prskill	Allow me!
c439_skill	No need for concern!
c439_spa	Self-control is fundamental for a pop star.
c439_startbt	I'm done giving up.
c439_story1	*sigh* That was close.\I almost ended up confessing to him.
c439_story2	This is the Juliet costume\that Maestro had prepared.\I thought I'd never get a chance to wear it.
c439_story3	Please wait for me, Maestro.
c439_true1	This isn't the time for hesitation.\I must let Maestro know how I feel.
c439_true2	I want to be by Maestro's side forever.
c439_true3	They keep telling me I'm working too hard.\But I'm all right.\If it's for Maestro, I...
c439_victory	I'm glad I didn't give up.
c440_boss_long	Your beautiful Mona has arrived. ♡
c440_boss_short	I'm here!
c440_ctskill	This is going to sting.
c440_death_1	Ouch. Let me take a little break.
c440_death_2	Ack. I didn't know this was coming...
c440_drive	Let's have some fun, shall we?
c440_hit_1	Ow, ow, ow!
c440_hit_2	That hurts!
c440_hit_3	Ugh!
c440_prskill	Here we go!
c440_skill	And take this!
c440_spa	Ahh! Soaking in a hot spring is so relaxing.
c440_startbt	All right, let's get started! ♡
c440_story1	Hee hee. I can't believe you dragged me into this. ♡
c440_story2	The Queen doesn't seem to like them.\I don't know if it's a good idea for you to keep this carrot patch.
c440_story3	Hee hee. This is silly, but everyone seems to enjoy it.
c440_true1	The sky looks remarkably blue today.\I haven't felt this refreshed in a long time.
c440_true2	I wonder what my little master is doing right now.\I hope he's not lost without me.
c440_true3	Sometimes my mind goes blank and I feel like I'm floating in the air.\I don't know if this is normal or not.
c440_victory	I won, as usual! ♡
c441_boss_long	Now is the time for justice!
c441_boss_short	Justice prevails!
c441_ctskill	That was lucky.
c441_death_1	Justice...cannot be defeated...
c441_death_2	Oh, no...!
c441_drive	I'll fight you with everything I have!
c441_hit_1	Ouch!
c441_hit_2	Urgh!
c441_hit_3	Ahhh!
c441_prskill	Isn't that a little...cowardly?
c441_skill	I've found the perpetrator!
c441_spa	I'm so sorry to enjoy it all by myself.
c441_startbt	I can't lose!
c441_story1	If you knew what it was, you could\have told me sooner.
c441_story2	Not on my watch! Prepare yourself, murderer!\Robin of Justice is coming to take you down!
c441_story3	Now that I know, Robin of Justice can't\just stand by and do nothing.
c441_true1	A hero may disappear, but justice lasts forever!\Huh... That actually sounded kinda cool! Time to write it down.
c441_true2	No matter what hurdles obstruct its path, justice\never falters. Isn't that right? Hehehe.
c441_true3	You aren't half bad as a master, you know\that? I'm glad we met.
c441_victory	Justice always prevails! Hehehe.
c442_10_boss_long	I'll purge all sins.
c442_10_boss_short	Come, foolish one.
c442_10_ctskill	Be enlightened.
c442_10_death_1	I see the shore of enlightenment.
c442_10_death_2	I perish along with my anguish...
c442_10_drive	I must be freed from all anguish.
c442_10_hit_1	Aah...
c442_10_hit_2	I repent.
c442_10_hit_3	Please protect me.
c442_10_prskill	I will cross the sea of pain.
c442_10_skill	Begone!
c442_10_spa	Everything, black or white, comes out of you.\Be careful not to incline toward either side.
c442_10_startbt	Is this where I belong?
c442_10_story1	She's somewhere in this world.\If we're meant to see each other again, we will.
c442_10_story2	Welcome. A set of luxury utensils made by a master craftsman\is now only 9,990 yen...
c442_10_story3	Maybe I wouldn't be too ashamed to see you again\if I free myself from all my anguish some day.
c442_10_true1	I see countless faces inside you.\I don't know how you're going to embrace them all...
c442_10_true2	I reunited with Arhat in the darkened room.\My ears still ring from her cries.
c442_10_true3	Let the past go.\What matters is the present.
c442_10_victory	I've severed yet another karmic string.
c442_boss_long	What's your karma?
c442_boss_short	Be enlightened.
c442_ctskill	Stop hating others.
c442_death_1	Life is pain.
c442_death_2	This is my karma...
c442_drive	Om ga ra si ya sva ha.
c442_hit_1	Life is so meaningless.
c442_hit_2	Whew...
c442_hit_3	Ugh...!
c442_prskill	Be gone, evil spirit.
c442_skill	Stay calm.
c442_spa	Everything, both black and white, comes from you.\Be careful not to lean tow either side.
c442_startbt	Let me guide you to Nirvana.
c442_story1	She's somewhere in this world. If we're meant to see\each other again, we will.
c442_story2	Welcome. A set of luxury utensils made by a master craftsman\is now only 9,990 yen...
c442_story3	Maybe I wouldn't be too ashamed to see you again\if I free myself from all my anguish some day.
c442_true1	I realized everything in the world had weakness.\And the greatest weakest of all was my mind.
c442_true2	The more I return to life, the weaker I am.\Arhat always comes back strong as iron.
c442_true3	We'll reform the exorcists with Arhat at the helm.\We'll reclaim the light we've lost.
c442_victory	They all are at peace now.
c443_boss_long	I'm here for your treasure.
c443_boss_short	What do you cherish most?
c443_ctskill	Luck is another way of meaning skill.
c443_death_1	Ugh, Logan...
c443_death_2	Next time... I'll...
c443_drive	I warned you.
c443_hit_1	Urgh!
c443_hit_2	Interesting.
c443_hit_3	Hmpf!
c443_prskill	Give up.
c443_skill	I'm not going to go easy on you.
c443_spa	This is unexpected.\How'd you find such a nice spot?
c443_startbt	How 'bout I show you what I can do?
c443_story1	Everyone, stay tuned to hear about PHAN+IC's newest derring-do!
c443_story2	Yeah, it's going to be tough.\But that's what makes me want it even more.
c443_story3	Once again, thank you, Demon.\I don't think I'd have this opportunity anywhere else, even in New York.
c443_true1	I'll do anything\to impress Logan.
c443_true2	I must condition myself to be\the kind of thief other thieves whisper about. Okay, I need to start with the perfect scheme.
c443_true3	There's nothing PHAN+IC the Phantom Thieves can't purloin\from out of the moonlight. Its glow shows us where the treasures sparkle brightest.
c443_victory	Perfect.
c445_10_boss_long	Stop resisting.
c445_10_boss_short	Are you afraid?
c445_10_ctskill	Are you tired already?
c445_10_death_1	Suhana... for you...
c445_10_death_2	I'll stay with you.
c445_10_drive	Oh, marvelous night.
c445_10_hit_1	Exciting, isn't it?
c445_10_hit_2	I'll repay you in kind.
c445_10_hit_3	Ooof!
c445_10_prskill	Your life is mine.
c445_10_skill	Interesting.
c445_10_spa	Sometimes, it's necessary to retreat and rest.\To prepare for a new battle.
c445_10_startbt	Want blood?
c445_10_story1	Sometimes in life you have to make choices. I had two options,\and I chose the path that took me away from that life.
c445_10_story2	Night is mysterious.\Things that you don't see during the day come out of hiding.
c445_10_story3	You're not Suhana, but... I still feel the connection.\I can't help but open up like we know each other.
c445_10_true1	I just wanted to live peacefully with Suhana.\Where did things go wrong?
c445_10_true2	Have you seen Nirrti? I think she left the house\for a walk, again. Bah, she's such a handful.
c445_10_true3	As humiliating as it is to admit,\I can't protect Suhana on my own.
c445_10_victory	Good job!
c445_11_boss_long	Stop resisting.
c445_11_boss_short	Are you afraid?
c445_11_ctskill	Are you tired already?

c445_88_boss_short	Let's see how strong you are.
c445_88_bubble_prskill	Is that all?
c445_88_bubble_skill	That's it?
c445_88_ctskill	Shut up.

c445_death_2	Suhana...
c445_drive	Goddess of Light!
c445_hit_1	Don't do that!
c445_hit_2	Goh...
c445_hit_3	Urgh!
c445_prskill	You're awful confident, aren't you?
c445_skill	Go away.
c445_spa	Sometimes, it's necessary to retreat and rest.\To prepare for a new battle.
c445_startbt	I won't take long.
c445_story1	Sometimes in life you have to make choices. I had two options,\and I chose the path that took me away from that life.

c445_story3	You're not Suhana, but... I still feel the connection.\I can't help but open up like we know each other.
c445_true1	Kumari knows everything.\That's a lie.
c445_true2	The more I try to shut myself off, the more I open myself up.\Geez, this is not good.
c445_true3	Suhana is a miracle to me.\The only miracle the gods have seen fit to bestow on me.
c445_victory	Not bad.
c446_88_boss_long	The survivors are the victors.
c446_88_boss_short	Can you defeat me?
c446_88_bubble_prskill	I will show you fear.
c446_88_bubble_skill	I see your weakness.
c446_88_ctskill	Will you run?

c446_story3	He's a wannabe demon,\working for humans to get by?
c446_true1	I have gone through hell and back on countless battlefields.\But no battle was more fierce than a married couple's quarrel.
c446_true2	Amos Island is not a bad place.\The scenery is lovely... But the war of the spouses is terribly incredible.
c446_true3	A mercenary's role is to serve at\their client's leisure. That is my worth.
c446_victory	Is this it?
c447_10_boss_long	Misterium Fidei.
c447_10_boss_short	Thou Wouldst Come Down!
c447_10_ctskill	O' Lord, please accept my offering.
c447_10_death_1	This is hell...
c447_10_death_2	I'm not backing out.
c447_10_drive	It is a day of slaughter!
c447_10_hit_1	Not bad.
c447_10_hit_2	Is that it?
c447_10_hit_3	That tickles!
c447_10_prskill	Fear me all you want.
c447_10_skill	Benedicimus te.
c447_10_spa	I'm a traveler heading to hell.\Is this a haven for poor travelers like me? Heh heh.
c447_10_startbt	Redemption doesn't come for free.
c447_10_story1	Fortune follows not the foolish.
c447_10_story2	There must be at least one thing in this world\that you can call hope.
c447_10_story3	I promised him that I'd become\the world's greatest and coolest exorcist.
c447_10_true1	The fact that you've met me means the gates of punishment have been opened.\What did you do wrong?
c447_10_true2	Patience and perseverance are the two most important virtues required of the servants of God.\In that sense, I'm not a very good one. Heh heh!
c447_10_true3	Why should I feel sorry for you?\Even if I did, God wouldn't reward me.
c447_10_victory	God's mercy rains on us. Hah hah hah!
c447_87_boss_long	Gloria tibi Domine.
c447_87_boss_short	Would you like to pray before you die?

c447_89_death_1	No more mercy...
c447_89_death_2	This isn't over...
c447_89_drive	Hallowed be thy name!
c447_89_hit_1	Hah hah hah!
c447_89_hit_2	How vile!
c447_89_hit_3	What happened?
c447_89_hit_4	I don't want scars.
c447_89_hit_5	Ugh!
c447_89_hit_6	Why do you yet live?
c447_89_hit_7	Wah!
c447_89_hit_8	Give up already.
c447_89_hit_9	Bah!
c447_89_prskill	No more mercy!
c447_89_skill	You raise me up.
c447_boss_long	I came to spread God's love.
c447_boss_short	Let us pray.
c447_ctskill	Heathens, begone!
c447_death_1	No more mercy...
c447_death_2	This isn't over...
c447_drive	Hallowed be thy name!
c447_hit_1	Heh heh.
c447_hit_2	How hasty!
c447_hit_3	Stop struggling.
c447_prskill	Dear God, I plead with you.
c447_skill	Resistance is futile.
c447_spa	I'm a traveler heading to hell.\Is this a haven for poor travelers like me? Heh heh.
c447_startbt	Defende nos in prelio.
c447_story1	Fortune follows not the foolish.
c447_story2	There must be at least one thing in this world\that you can call hope.
c447_story3	I promised him that I'd become\the world's greatest and coolest exorcist.
c447_true1	Why does everyone resist? It's so unnecessary.\It only compounds their sins.
c447_true2	I've always prayed for one thing:\please let this hell be over already.
c447_true3	Even the greatest sinner could avoid his punishment if he's lucky.\But it would take a lot of luck. Hah hah!
c447_victory	I deserve more than a simple compliment.
c448_88_boss_long	Oh, great. An unwelcomed guest.
c448_88_boss_short	I wish not to be bothered.
c448_88_bubble_prskill	Get ready!
c448_88_bubble_skill	Hang on tight ♡

c448_88_hit_1	Ah! A scratch!
c448_88_hit_2	You're not getting away!
c448_88_hit_3	Not bad.

c448_drive	Ugh... This is boring.
c448_hit_1	Ah!
c448_hit_2	Kyaaak!
c448_hit_3	Huh...
c448_prskill	This might sting a bit.
c448_skill	Get ready.
c448_spa	I prefer blood to water. This is... disappointing.
c448_startbt	Oh, we met again.
c448_story1	*sigh* You humans are no better than demons.
c448_story2	Oh... ♡ I'm sorry.\I was thirsty, and it made me a bit naughty.
c448_story3	Hmm... You're probably mistaken. ♡
c448_true1	I hate hypocrites.\They close their eyes and ears, and insist that they're right all the time.
c448_true2	I hate being bored.\Is there nothing to do?
c448_true3	Maybe sleeping in has its advantages at times.\Look how much the world has changed as I rested.
c448_victory	Ooh, such interesting results!
c449_boss_long	So... you came to me voluntarily.
c449_boss_short	What? Did you come for me?
c449_ctskill	Stop. Begone!
c449_death_1	You're stronger than I expected...
c449_death_2	This isn't over.
c449_drive	Will you cease being a nuisance and go?
c449_hit_1	Urgh!
c449_hit_2	Ah!
c449_hit_3	Eeek!
c449_prskill	Are you sure?
c449_skill	Can you handle this?
c449_spa	Finally, I can relax. Aah... This feels so good.\I wish it could always be this way.
c449_startbt	Stay focused.
c449_story1	There's nothing delicious to partake of in the mountains!
c449_story2	Yes, Mina. The search continues.\Give me a hoot if you spot a vamp, okay?
c449_story3	Because hunting vampires\requires a special kind of bullet.
c449_true1	I don't care if I have to sleep in the mountains.\I will find my family's treasure.
c449_true2	My family did some really cruel things in the past.\But that's over.
c449_true3	My family's honor is at stake.\Nothing can stop me!
c449_victory	Of course, I won.
c450_boss_long	Who are you?
c450_boss_short	The hurt... I don't like it.
c450_ctskill	I'll do what I can!
c450_death_1	Attis... I want to see you...
c450_death_2	Save me... Attis...
c450_drive	I want you to know how I feel!
c450_hit_1	Ahh!
c450_hit_2	Ngh!
c450_hit_3	I'm all right.
c450_prskill	We're not scared!
c450_skill	Wait...
c450_spa	Phew...\It's a bit hot, but I can handle it.\I'll get used to it in no time.
c450_startbt	I won't run away. Not anymore.
c450_story1	You don't trust me, do you?\Even though you're the only one for me.
c450_story2	I hurt someone\who has never once experienced love.\Oh no... What should I do?!
c450_story3	Maybe he said that because he's sad—\because he's never experienced love.\Do you think?
c450_true1	The instant I met Attis\I felt we were destined for each other.
c450_true2	I don't want to live in a world without Attis.\He wouldn't want a world without me, either. Right?
c450_true3	I'm glad I was born.\I'm glad I met Attis.
c450_victory	I decided I wouldn't cry anymore.
c451_boss_long	Time for a little fun.
c451_boss_short	Sure, I'll play with you.
c451_ctskill	I'll make this quick!

c451_spa	Nothing like a hot spring to wash a day's tiredness away,\wouldn't you agree?

c451_story1	I should treat myself every once in a while.\Plus, marrons glacés... ♪
c451_story2	You have zero tact, you know that?\It's basic manners to knock before you\barge into someone's room.

c451_true1	I am the woman tengu of the Miyama...\Um, never mind.
c451_true2	Relaxing on an island is pretty nice...\A mission?\What ever do you mean?
c451_true3	Hmph. Stay out of my business.\I don't care to have others tell me what to do.

c453_boss_long	Hello, I am Mercury.
c453_boss_short	Welcome.
c453_ctskill	Can I help you?
c453_death_1	I'm sorry for not being with you...
c453_death_2	This is it for me...
c453_drive	My turn next.
c453_hit_1	What is...
c453_hit_2	Urgh!
c453_hit_3	I'm fine.
c453_prskill	Uninvited guests are not welcome here.
c453_skill	I am quite serious.
c453_spa	There's a lovely hot spring on Amos Island.\I will invite you properly next time.
c453_startbt	This won't be easy.
c453_story1	Oh my, please calm down.\I don't just go around killing people.
c453_story2	There are demons who often make mistakes without learning to adapt to human society.\She must be an inexperienced demon.
c453_story3	Right, I hope you two stop fighting and make amends.\Farewell!
c453_true1	It's strange, right? Even though they love each other, they\fight constantly... But that's what makes it interesting. Hehehe!
c453_true2	Tiwaz is too kind for her own good.\Perhaps, that's just her character.
c453_true3	What Tiwaz needs might not be affection,\but empathy.
c453_victory	This is easy for me.
c454_88_boss_long	Care to see who's stronger?
c454_88_boss_short	Do you like tag?
c454_88_bubble_prskill	Be careful.
c454_88_bubble_skill	Gotcha!
c454_88_ctskill	Watch yourself.
c454_88_death_1	It's for your own sake...
c454_88_death_2	Gah!
c454_88_drive	Shall we dance?

c454_88_prskill	Be careful.
c454_88_skill	I got you!
c454_boss_long	Let the party begin!
c454_boss_short	Seems like I have an uninvited guest.
c454_ctskill	Watch yourself.
c454_death_1	It's for your own sake...
c454_death_2	Gah!
c454_drive	Shall we dance?
c454_hit_1	Go away.
c454_hit_2	Hmpf!
c454_hit_3	You've got some fight in you.
c454_prskill	Now it's starting to get interesting.
c454_skill	So bothersome.
c454_spa	I came here after hearing so much about it...\Well, it's not too bad.
c454_startbt	Can you please step away from Tiwaz?
c454_story1	You're right. War isn't my thing.\I'm just a delinquent who enjoys a good party.
c454_story2	What do I tell Tiwaz? *sigh* I've had to\tell an ocean of lies since I met her.
c454_story3	No. You're wonderful. I don't care what you like\or how you look.
c454_true1	Can you please step away from Tiwaz?\If you don't want to deal with a jealous demon, that is.
c454_true2	Don't be so wary. I'm kind to my friends.\Seems like you still don't trust me.
c454_true3	I would do anything for Tiwaz.\But I doubt she feels the same way...
c454_victory	Just as I expected.
c455_10_boss_long	Let the party begin!
c455_10_boss_short	Welcome.
c455_10_ctskill	Can I help you?
c455_10_death_1	I love you...
c455_10_death_2	What a shame...
c455_10_drive	You're in need of a good scolding.
c455_10_hit_1	Aaah!
c455_10_hit_2	Please, step aside.
c455_10_hit_3	That tickles.
c455_10_prskill	Please, go easy on me.
c455_10_skill	Boo!
c455_10_spa	Stay with me. Let's have a chat.\Oh? Your face is red. Are you not feeling well?
c455_10_startbt	Hehe. What do you think about me?
c455_10_story1	Teehee! It tickles if you hug me like that!
c455_10_story2	Maybe it's because we have more people,\but the house is a lot livelier than before.
c455_10_story3	That's why I prepared a gift!\Aren't you curious about what it is?
c455_10_true1	The moment I saw you, I felt something...\A warm feeling arising from inside of me.
c455_10_true2	Hee hee. Your face is so red.\Are you embarrassed? You're so cute.
c455_10_true3	Maybe you'll be the one who understands me.\Do you sense them? My true feelings...
c455_10_victory	Well done.
c455_12_boss_long	Welcome to our wedding.

c455_12_true1	To think Juno and I are marrying again...\I'm so excited.\I do really love him.

c455_86_death_2	Can't I stay here a little longer...?
c455_86_hit_1	Tee hee hee!
c455_86_hit_2	Wagh!
c455_86_hit_3	It's like a dream!
c455_86_hit_4	I'm so happy.

c455_86_skill	It's a perfect wedding march!
c455_boss_long	You can't just come in here uninvited~
c455_boss_short	I don't think I've seen you before?
c455_ctskill	Can we please make up?
c455_death_1	I don't like fighting.
c455_death_2	I need a break...
c455_drive	Dance with me!
c455_hit_1	Oh, that gave me a start!
c455_hit_2	Ooof!
c455_hit_3	Oops, my bad.
c455_prskill	I'm being serious.
c455_skill	Tada!
c455_spa	Stay with me. Let's have a chat.\Oh? Your face is red. Are you not feeling well?
c455_startbt	Hi there, friend.
c455_story1	Teehee! It tickles if you hug me like that!
c455_story2	Maybe it's because we have more people,\but the house is a lot livelier than before.
c455_story3	That's why I prepared a gift!\Aren't you curious about what it is?
c455_true1	Welcome to Amos Island. I hope you can forget about all your\hardships and find happiness here.
c455_true2	We're friends now, right?\Yay! Let's have a party in celebration of our friendship!
c455_true3	If I could see people's feelings,\maybe I could have avoided hurting Juno.
c455_victory	I did a good job, right?
c456_boss_long	Want to win a jackpot?
c456_boss_short	Welcome!
c456_ctskill	Wow! Jackpot!
c456_death_1	Let me try the next table.
c456_death_2	I don't like violent demons.
c456_drive	Bets on the table!
c456_hit_1	Kyaaak!
c456_hit_2	That hurts!
c456_hit_3	Ooof!
c456_prskill	This game is over.
c456_skill	Could you step aside?
c456_spa	Oh, this feels so wonderful! My skin feels so smooth, too.\Want to touch? Oh, my... Do you really want to touch me?
c456_startbt	Nice to see you.
c456_story1	I didn't cheat, but if you say so,\I'll play one more round with you to be honorable.
c456_story2	Ah, being gorgeous is so troublesome!
c456_story3	How about we bet on who's going to win?
c456_true1	Some people wear their emotions on their faces.\And they shouldn't gamble. Get it?
c456_true2	Juno's so handsome. Oh, please\don't get me wrong. I just like handsome faces.
c456_true3	Sometimes I'm envious of Juno\and Tiwaz. They love each other so much.
c456_victory	I won.
c457_boss_long	Would you care for some tea?
c457_boss_short	Come on in.
c457_ctskill	Not bad, wouldn't you agree?
c457_death_1	Seems like that wasn't enough..
c457_death_2	Traveling again...
c457_drive	Please, do not interfere.
c457_hit_1	Not bad.
c457_hit_2	Excellent.
c457_hit_3	Ugh...!
c457_prskill	Would you please step aside?
c457_skill	Please, stay still.
c457_spa	This place has a gentle charm to it.\It's almost as pleasant as teatime.
c457_startbt	Preparations are complete.
c457_story1	I am happy to have found a companion\to sit and sip with.
c457_story2	In any case, I do so hope their conflict will be resolved peacefully.
c457_story3	I am thinking that I wish to continue traveling until I can reach/whatever place it was that pactmaker could not reach.
c457_true1	I feel like it won't be long before our life bursts into war.\Of course, when that time comes I must not lose.
c457_true2	Lady Argos seems to be fond of teatime.\I should prepare better tea.
c457_true3	Everyone needs their personal space.\So could you pretend you didn't see me?
c457_victory	The party is over.
c458_boss_long	Let's try it.
c458_boss_short	Let's make this a fair showdown.
c458_ctskill	I'll pass you right now!
c458_death_1	You're lucky, kiddo.
c458_death_2	Bah, I let my guard down!
c458_drive	I'm going to win, no matter what.
c458_hit_1	Ugh!
c458_hit_2	Drat!
c458_hit_3	Not a chance!
c458_prskill	You really think you're good enough to beat me?
c458_skill	*yawn* Boring.
c458_spa	Hmm... Are we seeing who can stay in the hot water longer?
c458_startbt	Welcome to the world of competition.
c458_story1	Come on! Get up and face me! Fair and square!
c458_story2	Seems the contest of their affections has come to a draw.\But that won't do. I must think bigger!
c458_story3	A split second can determine the outcome of a race.\I must be perfect, or else I might lose.
c458_true1	Racing is all about\cornering skills.
c458_true2	It only takes a blink of time to lose.\My nerves are always racing because of that.
c458_true3	Racing has freed me\and made me the best in the world.
c458_victory	This was expected. You're not surprised, are you?
c459_boss_long	Only Cacus deserves to be Archfiend.
c459_boss_short	I'll defeat you. For Cacus.
c459_ctskill	Watch out. I might kill you.
c459_death_1	Please take care of Cacus...
c459_death_2	Oh, no...
c459_drive	You're a real handful.
c459_hit_1	Gaaah!
c459_hit_2	Ugh...
c459_hit_3	Gah. I underestimated you.
c459_prskill	Be careful.
c459_skill	This is taking longer than I thought.
c459_spa	Hm... I wish Cacus was here...
c459_startbt	Did you lose something?
c459_story1	Cacus,\don't talk with your mouth full.
c459_story2	I let that poor human get away despite how she treated me, but you're a Child.\You need to be taught a lesson.
c459_story3	...If Cacus can't do it, I'll do it for her.\She needs to become Archfiend.
c459_true1	I don't care about the Archfiend anymore.\By the way, where's Cacus?
c459_true2	I really want Cacus to become Archfiend.\Prickly or not, she's my sister.
c459_true3	I want Cacus to be happy,\so I can be happy.
c459_victory	So, what's it like to lose?
c460_88_boss_long	I've been waiting.
c460_88_boss_short	Do you have a death wish?
c460_88_bubble_prskill	You sure you can handle this?
c460_88_bubble_skill	Are you scared of me?
c460_88_ctskill	Mind your manners.
c460_88_death_1	Not yet...
c460_88_death_2	Ngh...
c460_88_drive	It's payback time!
c460_88_hit_1	Cute.
c460_88_hit_2	Get ready.
c460_88_hit_3	Urgh!
c460_88_hit_4	That hurt.

c460_88_hit_9	Interesting.
c460_88_prskill	You sure you can handle this?
c460_88_skill	Are you scared of me?
c460_boss_long	I'll protect you.
c460_boss_short	Hello?
c460_ctskill	Mind your manners.
c460_death_1	Not yet...
c460_death_2	Ngh...
c460_drive	It's payback time!
c460_hit_1	This is nothing!
c460_hit_2	Ack...
c460_hit_3	Hah hah!
c460_prskill	My turn!
c460_skill	Be good.
c460_spa	This place smells wonderful.\I'd love to come back here with her.
c460_startbt	Have you seen my friend?
c460_story1	Where are you?\I really want to see you again.
c460_story2	Don't worry. I'm here now.\I'll protect you no matter what...
c460_story3	At first, I was nervous about getting a job in the Mortal Realm,\but, so far, it's been better than I thought.
c460_true1	I can never forget my lost Child\or the demon who took her.
c460_true2	I'll never forget the time I spent with her.\I wonder if she still remembers me.
c460_true3	I'm going to reclaim her\and free other Childs.
c460_victory	Want a compliment?
c461_10_boss_long	Ah, you got me. Heh heh.
c461_10_boss_short	Did you look for me?
c461_10_ctskill	I'm awesome, am I not?
c461_10_death_1	I don't want to say goodbye...
c461_10_death_2	Don't cry, demon...
c461_10_drive	I'll be with you.
c461_10_hit_1	Go away!
c461_10_hit_2	I'm fine.
c461_10_hit_3	I'm angry!
c461_10_prskill	Could you step aside?
c461_10_skill	Ho ho.
c461_10_spa	Demon, this place is expensive, isn't it?\I know you don't have money, so I won't stay too long.
c461_10_startbt	Buck up!
c461_10_story1	Voila! "Deep sleep therapy" for Mitra!\We set it up because we don't want you to have any more nightmares.
c461_10_story2	Don't you feel suffocated by the terrible stories you're keeping to yourself?\Let me share your burden.
c461_10_story3	Heh heh. Davi taught me to do that\if I encountered a dangerous demon.
c461_10_true1	Hello! I'm Aurora.\Let's be friends.
c461_10_true2	Demon, did you finish your homework?\Then... could you show it to me? It's too hard...
c461_10_true3	Demon, did you have another nightmare?\Nightmares, go away! You'll be fine now. Hee hee!
c461_10_victory	You can rest now, demon.
c461_boss_long	You're here. Teehee!
c461_boss_short	Here comes Aurora!
c461_ctskill	Is it my turn?
c461_death_1	I'm too sleepy...
c461_death_2	Goodbye, demon...
c461_drive	Demon, I like you!
c461_hit_1	Ouch!
c461_hit_2	I'm hurt...
c461_hit_3	Ahhh!
c461_prskill	I'll punish them!
c461_skill	I'll protect you!
c461_spa	Demon, this place is expensive, isn't it?\I know you don't have money, so I won't stay too long.
c461_startbt	Did you wait for me?
c461_story1	Voila! "Deep sleep therapy" for Mitra!\We set it up because we don't want you to have any more nightmares.
c461_story2	Don't you feel suffocated by the terrible stories you're keeping to yourself?\Let me share your burden.
c461_story3	Heh heh. Davi taught me to do that\if I encountered a dangerous demon.
c461_true1	Welcome back, demon! I've been waiting for you.\Now, we'll be together forever.
c461_true2	Even if you get lost, don't worry.\I'll be your light like I was before.
c461_true3	I wish I could heal your mind...\
c461_victory	We won!
c462_boss_long	Open the gates of hell!
c462_boss_short	I will not yield.
c462_ctskill	Begone!
c462_death_1	If I can return to your garden...
c462_death_2	Not yet!
c462_drive	Please show me mercy gain!
c462_hit_1	Urggh!
c462_hit_2	I'm fine.
c462_hit_3	I let my guard down.
c462_prskill	This is for you.
c462_skill	Trust me.
c462_spa	Have you seen Sayoko?\Hehe. She can be so shy sometimes.
c462_startbt	Rise, my love.
c462_story1	You'll be stuck in hell until you overcome your guilt.\Can demons be saved?
c462_story2	I made her do it,\so I'm not going to let her carry the burden all by herself.
c462_story3	Why don't we spend some time here?\You said you didn't wanna go on a date, but...
c462_true1	The will to protect Sayoko isn't solely mine.\I've received it from her.
c462_true2	I can never go back to being human.\But so long as I have power, I don't care.
c462_true3	Maybe Sayoko's battle will never end.\I hope my sword will last for as long as I need it.
c462_victory	My sword will not break.
c463_boss_long	Want to challenge me?
c463_boss_short	Stop bothering me.
c463_ctskill	Don't you want to get away?
c463_death_1	Oh no. I can see the depths of Hell.
c463_death_2	Ngh...
c463_drive	This is your destiny.
c463_hit_1	Do it right.
c463_hit_2	How funny!
c463_hit_3	Hmph!
c463_prskill	Let me test you.
c463_skill	What a bother.
c463_spa	This place is a bit...noisy. Can we go somewhere quieter?
c463_startbt	Want me to come with you?
c463_story1	No one messes with what's mine\and gets away with it.
c463_story2	Regardless, he's mine now.\I must take care of him until the end.
c463_story3	This energy... It feels familiar.\It can't be you...can it?
c463_true1	Leo's a handful.\He's clever, but he gets upset too easily.\He's such a crybaby.
c463_true2	I originally joined the Contest to sever the chain of misfortune that followed me.\But now, my goal is bigger than that.
c463_true3	I like it when you pretend to be human.\Even they would think you're funny.
c463_victory	Now we're even.
c464_10_boss_long	Dear Honored One...
c464_10_boss_short	I will move forward!
c464_10_ctskill	This is pain.
c464_10_death_1	We shall meet again, my friend...
c464_10_death_2	Don't be sad.
c464_10_drive	This is your punishment!
c464_10_hit_1	Oh, no.
c464_10_hit_2	I was careless.
c464_10_hit_3	This is my karma.
c464_10_prskill	Cares, begone!
c464_10_skill	Nilakanthaya svaha.
c464_10_spa	I haven't felt so peaceful for a long time.
c464_10_startbt	The gates of Avici Hell have opened!
c464_10_story1	I remember all the people\who've cherished and loved me.
c464_10_story2	You were already born from a human's mind.\You can see more things than I can.
c464_10_story3	Even if you retrieved everything you've lost,\you may not regain the happiness you once had.
c464_10_true1	I've lived for a long time.\Now and then the time I've lived feels as transient as the wind.
c464_10_true2	An abundance of words can clog your mind.\Sometimes you need not say anything, only see.
c464_10_true3	You're carrying a mountain of karma.\My poor friend. I wish I could share your burden.
c464_10_victory	Namu loke arhatanam.
c464_11_boss_long	Another potential connection.
c464_11_boss_short	Break the chains of your sins.
c464_11_ctskill	How bizarre! Excruciating pain!
c464_11_death_1	Where should I go now?
c464_11_death_2	Please guide us...
c464_11_drive	I'll turn the wheel of law and break the chains of pain!
c464_11_hit_1	Oh, no...
c464_11_hit_2	I'm okay.
c464_11_hit_3	Ah!
c464_11_prskill	Nothing lasts forever.
c464_11_skill	Perish.
c464_11_spa	Not everything you see is true.\Don't settle for momentary happiness.
c464_11_startbt	It's my turn to help you.
c464_11_story1	Love can easily turn into attachment.\I cannot allow myself to partake of that aggrandizement.
c464_11_story2	I'll eradicate the demons to avenge my friends.\After that, I'll come find you.
c464_11_story3	Come on! Wake from your dream.\Find your way. The present is all we have.
c464_11_true1	Everyone—animals, humans, and even demons—has their own karma.\But that's okay. Your karma always leads you to a new beginning.
c464_11_true2	Once you lose a connection with someone, you can never mend it.\You must cherish everyone you know.
c464_11_true3	I cherish all of you—you, Nirrti, Kalaratri,\and everyone else. As do you, yes?
c464_11_victory	This is true repentance.
c464_boss_long	Come, meaningless ones.
c464_boss_short	I shall prevail!
c464_ctskill	Kusumbharatnā!
c464_death_1	I can't stop...now...
c464_death_2	Pain is only momentary...
c464_drive	Bandha bandhane vajrapane!
c464_hit_1	Don't do that!
c464_hit_2	How dare you?
c464_hit_3	Ooof!
c464_prskill	I can see through you.
c464_skill	Perish!
c464_spa	I haven't felt so peaceful for a long time.
c464_startbt	Don't be afraid.
c464_story1	I remember all the people\who've cherished and loved me.
c464_story2	You were already born from a human's mind.\You can see more things than I can.
c464_story3	Even if you retrieved everything you've lost,\you may not regain the happiness you once had.
c464_true1	I'll heal your mind as you heal mine.\I believe this is why we met.
c464_true2	Don't let your mind get lost.\If you need help, you can always hold my hand.
c464_true3	Dwelling on the past is meaningless.\And yet, I can't help but have regrets.
c464_victory	This is all because of you.
c465_boss_long	Nice to meet you. My name is Sunah.
c465_boss_short	Why don't you just go on your way?
c465_ctskill	Let's get this over with.
c465_death_1	I'm sorry...
c465_death_2	Ugh... Master...
c465_drive	I'll finish them all at once.
c465_hit_1	Ugh...!
c465_hit_2	Ooof!
c465_hit_3	Hhhkkk...!
c465_prskill	You'd better get ready.
c465_skill	Master, watch out!
c465_spa	You should rest... I'm sorry.
c465_startbt	I'll do my best.
c465_story1	I'll help, too! Let's get the place cleaned up as best as we can.\We must be useful to our master, after all.
c465_story2	Come on, now. As you know, all training begins and ends with meditation.\Sit still and focus.
c465_story3	Nezha, please don't destroy the house. ♡\Okaaay?
c465_true1	I'll even give my life up in your name...if you need me to.
c465_true2	This is all my fault.\Please forgive Nezha. She still has much to learn.
c465_true3	What I really wanted to protect was friendship,\and I realized it too late.
c465_victory	I serve only you.
c466_boss_long	Hello! Let's have some fun, shall we?
c466_boss_short	Here comes Nezha!
c466_ctskill	Think you can beat me? Hehe!
c466_death_1	What the...?
c466_death_2	Ugh, this can't be happening...
c466_drive	This is so fun! Hehe!
c466_hit_1	Ahhh!
c466_hit_2	Ugh...
c466_hit_3	Not a chance!
c466_prskill	Now it's my turn!
c466_skill	Come on, bring it on!
c466_spa	Oooh, I didn't know there was a place like this. It looks nice.
c466_startbt	This looks like fun.
c466_story1	If only I find just one Child to mess with. This day would be truly perfect.\Haha!
c466_story2	And here I thought you were just a foolishly loyal people pleaser.\But you're no less of a troublemaker yourself!
c466_story3	Hey, I'm no kid! I'm just trying to teach Davi to play fair\She keeps cheating!
c466_true1	I can beat any demon I want!\You don't know what you're talking about, Sunah. I'm super strong!
c466_true2	It's not like I want to destroy things... I just get carried away.\What, are you going to abandon me?
c466_true3	I just want to live with Sunah.\Fighting is fun, but meaningless without Sunah by my side.
c466_victory	Yay!
c467_boss_long	It's too late for regrets.
c467_boss_short	Welcome.
c467_ctskill	Foolish!
c467_death_1	Why do we have to fight?
c467_death_2	This is really upsetting...
c467_drive	Let's get this over with, shall we?
c467_hit_1	Uh-oh.
c467_hit_2	I let my guard down.
c467_hit_3	I'm all right.
c467_prskill	My turn.
c467_skill	Step back.
c467_spa	Oh, I didn't expect such a gift!\I'll never forget this.
c467_startbt	It would be my pleasure to help.
c467_story1	I wasn't going to forgive you, anyway.
c467_story2	I'm sorry, but your fight's with me now.\Don't worry, though. I'll make it worth your while.
c467_story3	Flins, you stubborn mule. Why do you want me to become Archfiend so badly?\That's the last thing I want.
c467_true1	You really don't want to make me angry.\If you insist, be prepared to face the consequences.
c467_true2	Taking the bull by the horns isn't always the best solution,\but sometimes it's the only solution.
c467_true3	Flins is too wild to tame,\which makes him all the more attractive. Ha ha.
c467_victory	I'm glad it's over.
c468_00_boss_long	I'd rather not fight, but...
c468_00_boss_short	You wouldn't surrender for me, would you?
c468_00_ctskill	You're not mad, are you?
c468_00_death_1	No luck this time.
c468_00_death_2	I'm fine...
c468_00_drive	Let's talk!
c468_00_hit_1	I don't want this!
c468_00_hit_2	You're mean!
c468_00_hit_3	Aah!
c468_00_prskill	Am I doing it right?
c468_00_skill	What's on your mind?
c468_00_spa	It's so hot...\Why's everyone getting in this scalding water?
c468_00_startbt	Do I have to fight, too?
c468_00_story1	I'm not reading any more minds.\All it does is hurt people.
c468_00_story2	I'm glad I got to meet so many different people.\Let's have something tasty at home, Auntie!
c468_00_story3	Hmm.\Someday... I hope I can be happy, too.
c468_00_true1	I don't wanna be home anymore.\Every single day mom and dad fight...\And it's always over money.
c468_00_true2	Auntie's not scary.\She's really nice.\So, why are men so scary?
c468_00_true3	I wish we could be happy like in other homes.\It's okay, though.\I've got friends on my side.
c468_00_victory	Oopsie. Looks like I won.\Hee hee.
c468_boss_long	Not everything will go as you want.
c468_boss_short	Stop wasting my time.
c468_ctskill	You're out of control!
c468_death_1	I'm sorry I can't help you...
c468_death_2	I can't... die like this...
c468_drive	I think I'm going to win.
c468_hit_1	Ouch!
c468_hit_2	Meanie.
c468_hit_3	Ack!
c468_prskill	Want me to punish them?
c468_skill	Boring.
c468_spa	It's hot! I don't understand you guys.\Why do you like to bathe in such hot water?
c468_startbt	You can't fool me.
c468_story1	I won't read people's mind unless it is necessary.\I find otherwise it only brings pain.
c468_story2	I'll be with you whenever need be.\We can watch our pactmakers together if you want.
c468_story3	Yes. Some people never change.\I hope my pactmaker will find happiness one day...
c468_true1	I never knew I'd feel happy\to be with others one day.
c468_true2	I know this world is full of malice.\But that not everyone in it is evil.
c468_true3	I want to show my honest feelings to everyone.\I don't want to hide them anymore.
c468_victory	Was I helpful?
c469_boss_long	Let's get this show started, shall we?
c469_boss_short	Watch me!
c469_ctskill	My turn!
c469_death_1	Owwie, I messed up.
c469_death_2	I should've rehearsed more...
c469_drive	Join me on this fantastic stage!
c469_hit_1	That hurt!
c469_hit_2	Ouch!
c469_hit_3	Ugh!
c469_prskill	You'll cheer for me, won't you?
c469_skill	Effort matters!
c469_spa	Nothing beats a hot bath\after a hard day's work.
c469_startbt	Welcome to Aria's show!
c469_story1	I can't wait for my outfit to be completed.\I want this show to be my best performance ever!
c469_story2	I didn't become famous just by looking pretty.\I worked for it, like this.
c469_story3	We worked too hard for this show to let it go to waste.\Let's deal with this problem before it gets worse!
c469_true1	I want to perform to the best of my ability\and shine like the stars!
c469_true2	It's fans that keep singers like me going.\No matter how tough things get, so long as I have my fans, I can sing.
c469_true3	Master, you're a better manager than I thought.\Maybe I should hire you as my personal manager.
c469_victory	Bye. See you again!
c470_boss_long	This show is for you!
c470_boss_short	I-I'll do my best!
c470_ctskill	Is it my turn?
c470_death_1	Let me try again.
c470_death_2	I put my soul into it...
c470_drive	This is MY stage!
c470_hit_1	Gah!
c470_hit_2	Ugh!
c470_hit_3	P-Please calm down...
c470_prskill	Can you hear me singing?
c470_skill	One, two—yaap!
c470_spa	Now, that I know the water,\it doesn't scare me anymore.
c470_startbt	I'll glisten just like the stars in the sky!
c470_story1	What can I do\until the new song is ready?
c470_story2	We're working hard\to become the greatest singers anyone has ever seen!
c470_story3	Venus♥, it's time you compose a new song.\If not for us, do it for Maestro.
c470_true1	Planet Party always remains dedicated.\Happiness will follow our hard work.
c470_true2	We can fight through anything,\no matter the odds or the distance.
c470_true3	We may have some critics out there,\but we'll continue to sing until everyone hears us.
c470_victory	I can dig in my heels when I have to.
c471_88_boss_long	Say Pretty Sweet Devi Sexy!
c471_88_boss_short	Here comes Devi Princess Mars♥!
c471_88_bubble_prskill	My sexy can't be beat.
c471_88_bubble_skill	I've got you now.
c471_88_ctskill	Don't blame me if you fall for me.
c471_88_death_1	Don't you ever forget about me!
c471_88_death_2	No way!
c471_88_drive	Get ready for my sweet charm!
c471_88_hit_1	Ow, ow, oww!
c471_88_hit_2	Seriously?!
c471_88_hit_3	I'll remember that!
c471_88_hit_4	Stop, stop!
c471_88_hit_5	Ouch!
c471_88_hit_6	I said, it hurt!
c471_88_hit_7	Let's do this the sweet way!
c471_88_hit_8	Go away, will you?
c471_88_hit_9	Who are you?
c471_88_prskill	My sexy can't be beat.
c471_88_skill	I've got you now.
c471_boss_long	Petite Devis, were you waiting for me?
c471_boss_short	Hello, Petite Devis!
c471_ctskill	Don't blame me if you fall for me.
c471_death_1	Don't you ever forget about me!
c471_death_2	No way!
c471_drive	Get ready for my sweet charm!
c471_hit_1	Ouch!
c471_hit_2	Enough!
c471_hit_3	You're going down!
c471_prskill	I'm here.
c471_skill	Eyes on me!
c471_spa	Wait, wait! You can't go past this point.\Don't wanna spoil the mystery.
c471_startbt	How about I do this sweetly?
c471_story1	I bet my fan club is going to burst at the seams with new members this time.\It's obvious: I'm the most lovely singer out there.
c471_story2	Don't be dumb! You're still a patient. We've found someone to fill in for you.\Don't worry about a thing. Just focus on getting better.
c471_story3	Aria... Could you join us in Planet Party?\We all want you to.
c471_true1	Am I scared of going up on stage?\Never—it's exciting, actually!
c471_true2	Pretty Sweet Devi-Sexy! This phrase is not catching on as quickly as I want.\Maybe I should trademark it first...
c471_true3	You can't help but get all smiley when you see me, can you?\See, pretty girl singers rule the world!
c471_victory	Sexy Mars♥ wins again!
c472_boss_long	My fans, are you there?
c472_boss_short	Let me entertain you.
c472_ctskill	Aren't I the best?
c472_death_1	I'm not done playing yet.
c472_death_2	Maybe next time...
c472_drive	I know you'll love me!
c472_hit_1	What?
c472_hit_2	Ugh!
c472_hit_3	How fun!
c472_prskill	For Venus♥!
c472_skill	Is anybody out there?
c472_spa	Ah, the water is so warm and relaxing.\I feel all my aches dissolving away.
c472_startbt	A new stage!
c472_story1	You lack a sense of adventure.\Life is to be relished! Don't waste time.
c472_story2	You're so spunky!\Seems promising! Show us what you got!
c472_story3	He didn't seem reliable to me at first,\but over time he's grown on me.
c472_true1	Lately, a puppy has been interrupting my naps.\She's cute but bothersome. Her name is Neptune♥.
c472_true2	Once you see me perform,\you'll never want to look away. I guarantee it.
c472_true3	Singers need their rest more than anything.\Maybe I should ask Maestro for a private bedroom...
c472_victory	That wasn't too bad.
c473_boss_long	You want a lesson, do you?
c473_boss_short	Hello, friends!
c473_ctskill	Found an opening!
c473_death_1	Ah hah hah, that didn't work...
c473_death_2	I won't forget this... Gaaah!
c473_drive	Do you trust me?
c473_hit_1	Please, be gentle.
c473_hit_2	Ugh, that hurt...
c473_hit_3	He's not making it easy for us.
c473_prskill	My turn, right?
c473_skill	Look here.
c473_spa	So hot and relaxing! Delightful! What?\You look jealous.
c473_startbt	Hah! Looking for me?
c473_story1	Master... When did you become\so insecure?
c473_story2	I couldn't go out and enjoy freedom\because I had to wait for you.
c473_story3	Ooh, that's great!\We can find them without actually doing the legwork.
c473_true1	Let's see... Master, you've changed so much\since I saw you the last time. But I still can tell it's you.
c473_true2	Don't worry. You may be lonely now, but soon\you'll be surrounded by many of us, like you used to be. Ho ho!
c473_true3	Thank you for finding me. You were a bit slow,\but I'll let it slide.
c473_victory	You can praise me as much as you want.
c474_10_boss_long	Interesting.
c474_10_boss_short	There's only one chance.
c474_10_ctskill	Enough!
c474_10_death_1	You won...
c474_10_death_2	I'll remember you...
c474_10_drive	I see flames.
c474_10_hit_1	What a cheap trick.
c474_10_hit_2	You'll regret this.
c474_10_hit_3	You've got guts.
c474_10_prskill	I warned you.
c474_10_skill	Can you defeat me?
c474_10_spa	If we have no business, leave me be.
c474_10_startbt	Don't try to run away.
c474_10_story1	Running away again? You keep wasting my time.\Oh well, I have no choice.\It's difficult to find a good apprentice.
c474_10_story2	You can be a great blacksmith.\Not as great as I am, of course.
c474_10_story3	That's a demon for you.\Of course, I'm different from them.\I'm destined to be the Creator...
c474_10_true1	Go down deeper.\Light is found in the darkest of places.
c474_10_true2	Funny. What do you think you can do\with your dying embers?
c474_10_true3	Create the strongest out of the weak.\That's my purpose.
c474_10_victory	This was expected.
c474_88_boss_long	No metal is stronger than an anvil and hammer.
c474_88_boss_short	There are impurities.
c474_88_bubble_prskill	My flames are still alive.
c474_88_bubble_skill	Stronger!
c474_88_ctskill	I'm not going to lose to you.
c474_88_death_1	I haven't finished...
c474_88_death_2	Ugh...
c474_88_drive	I'll become the Lord's flame!
c474_88_hit_1	Meaningless.
c474_88_hit_2	Tired already?
c474_88_hit_3	Well?
c474_88_hit_4	You'll be burned.
c474_88_hit_5	Urgh!
c474_88_hit_6	Hmpf!
c474_88_hit_7	Oh!
c474_88_hit_8	Too weak!
c474_88_hit_9	Oompf!
c474_88_prskill	My flames are still alive.
c474_88_skill	Stronger!
c474_89_boss_long	No metal is stronger than an anvil and hammer.
c474_89_boss_short	There are impurities.
c474_89_bubble_prskill	My flames are still alive.
c474_89_bubble_skill	Stronger!
c474_89_ctskill	I'm not going to lose to you.
c474_89_death_1	I haven't finished...
c474_89_death_2	Ugh...
c474_89_drive	I'll become the Lord's flame!
c474_89_hit_1	Meaningless.
c474_89_hit_2	Tired already?
c474_89_hit_3	Well?
c474_89_hit_4	You'll be burned.
c474_89_hit_5	Urgh!
c474_89_hit_6	Hmpf!
c474_89_hit_7	Oh!
c474_89_hit_8	Too weak!
c474_89_hit_9	Oompf!
c474_89_prskill	My flames are still alive.
c474_89_skill	Stronger!
c474_boss_long	Don't blame your death on me.
c474_boss_short	You can't beat me.
c474_ctskill	I'm not going to lose to you.
c474_death_1	I haven't finished...
c474_death_2	Ugh...
c474_drive	Engulf them, flames!
c474_hit_1	Urgh!
c474_hit_2	Too soft.
c474_hit_3	Satisfied?
c474_prskill	Raise your hammer!
c474_skill	Coward.
c474_spa	If we have no business, leave me be.
c474_startbt	Do you see it? The flames that will consume you...
c474_story1	Running away again? You keep wasting my time.\Oh well, I have no choice.\It's difficult to find a good apprentice.
c474_story2	You can be a great blacksmith.\Not as great as I am, of course.
c474_story3	That's a demon for you.\Of course, I'm different from them.\I'm destined to be the Creator...
c474_true1	I like deep, dark places.\They hide a light in their darkness.\A light that burns coldly but fiercely\with ancient knowledge stowed at its core.
c474_true2	You don't know your own Child's potential.\But don't worry.\I'll give her\a complete makeover.
c474_true3	Don't be afraid of the fire.\Don't try to conquer it, either.\What we blacksmiths do is\tend our fire while it does everything for us.
c474_victory	I'm going to go now.
c475_boss_long	This show is for you.
c475_boss_short	Enjoy the show!
c475_ctskill	I want you to remember me.
c475_death_1	This isn't easy.
c475_death_2	I'm not going to cry.
c475_drive	Let's sing together, shall we?
c475_hit_1	Easy-peasy!
c475_hit_2	Ugh!
c475_hit_3	Aaahhh!
c475_prskill	You didn't forget me, did you?
c475_skill	Ready?
c475_spa	I'm so relaxed that I might fall asleep. If you see me floating in the water,\please get me out.
c475_startbt	The stage calls.
c475_story1	(Maybe I'd feel better\if I confided in him.)
c475_story2	A small token of my gratitude.\If you're not busy, I'd love for you to come to our concert.
c475_story3	We should leave humans to their own kind.\We don't have to deal with them.
c475_true1	Staying together as Planet Party... Maybe that won't last forever,\but hopefully our songs will.
c475_true2	Maestro always overworks himself.\That's why I can't leave him alone.
c475_true3	Who's the most popular girl in the group?\I don't know... Sir Demon, who's your favorite?
c475_victory	See you again.
c476_00_boss_long	I don't have time for this. Let's do this quick.
c476_00_boss_short	Uh... who are you people?
c476_00_ctskill	Stay out of this.
c476_00_death_1	Well, that didn't work...
c476_00_death_2	What a shame...
c476_00_drive	You hurt me... I hurt you back.
c476_00_hit_1	Ngh.
c476_00_hit_2	Stop that.
c476_00_hit_3	Cut that out.
c476_00_prskill	You just don't get it.
c476_00_skill	Move...
c476_00_spa	If only we could be together forever...\N-Never mind.
c476_00_startbt	What? I don't want to fight.
c476_00_story1	Why am I telling this to a 9-year-old?
c476_00_story2	What are you trying to do?
c476_00_story3	It's been pretty lively since Chie came into my life.\All because some kid came to play...\Heh...
c476_00_true1	I'm beat...\Maybe I'll go straight to bed today.\I just want to sleep forever at this point.
c476_00_true2	I've been more relaxed since Chie started staying with me.\Is it because I was always on my own?
c476_00_true3	I felt so bad for Chie.\To think she'd be that nice to me.
c476_00_victory	Chie said she was hungry.
c476_88_boss_long	Does this mean we're meant to be with each other? Teehee!
c476_88_boss_short	Nice to see you.
c476_88_bubble_prskill	Ah, don't run away!
c476_88_bubble_skill	Let's have more fun!
c476_88_ctskill	You're not going to run, are you?
c476_88_death_1	Hah hah... See you later...
c476_88_death_2	Fighting is hard...
c476_88_drive	Watch out!
c476_88_hit_1	Ah hah hah!
c476_88_hit_2	Teehee!
c476_88_hit_3	Am I abrasive?
c476_88_hit_4	Gentle!
c476_88_hit_5	Ouch!
c476_88_hit_6	Aaah!
c476_88_hit_7	Oops!
c476_88_hit_8	Gyaaah!
c476_88_hit_9	Uh-oh.
c476_88_prskill	Ah, don't run away!
c476_88_skill	Let's have more fun!
c476_boss_long	Hello, everyone.
c476_boss_short	This is going to be fun!
c476_ctskill	You're not going to run, are you?
c476_death_1	Hah hah... See you later...
c476_death_2	Fighting is hard...
c476_drive	Let me show you what I've got!
c476_hit_1	Gaaah!
c476_hit_2	I'm not exaggerating!
c476_hit_3	Ngh!
c476_prskill	I can see you're hiding.
c476_skill	Want to play with me?
c476_spa	I hope you won't get angry even if I stay here all day.\Hah hah... I was just pulling your leg.
c476_startbt	Don't worry, Master.
c476_story1	Perhaps, my pactmaker will actually land a boyfriend for\the first time in history.
c476_story2	*sigh* I have no choice. I'll have to step in\and find the right man for my pactmaker.
c476_story3	Okay! Now, people say soulmates are drawn together\so yours is never far away. Let's look around first, shall we?
c476_true1	You don't have friends. That's disappointing.\I thought we were friends.
c476_true2	What are you thinking so hard? Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you...\Now that I did, want to chat with me?
c476_true3	I get it that you sometimes need alone time.\You can run away if you want. I'll wait for you.
c476_victory	Hah hah. I hope that wasn't too harsh.
c479_00_boss_long	You better give it your best.
c479_00_boss_short	A pleasure to meet you.
c479_00_ctskill	Oh, I'm sorry. I underestimated you.
c479_00_death_1	You're good.
c479_00_death_2	Oops.
c479_00_drive	Hah! Let's get this over with!
c479_00_hit_1	Urgh!
c479_00_hit_2	Guh.
c479_00_hit_3	You're terrible.
c479_00_prskill	My turn.
c479_00_skill	Heh heh. Be careful.
c479_00_spa	I've never wasted my time in a place like this.
c479_00_startbt	Oui.
c479_00_story1	Are you the type who relies on pure luck?\I can't stand people like that.
c479_00_story2	Everything I make is top tier. It has to be.
c479_00_story3	If I do nothing, I'll forever be forgotten as a fencer.\My pride is at stake.
c479_00_true1	No one can do surpass me. I'm the best.\Don't strain yourself.
c479_00_true2	What would I do if I lost? And why should I think of losing?\Defeat? I don't know the meaning of the word. I don't stop until I win.
c479_00_true3	I practice twice as hard as anyone else.\I give it my very best every day!
c479_00_victory	I'll be counting on you again next time.
c479_20_boss_long	Do you think you can beat me?
c479_20_boss_short	This'll be fun.
c479_20_ctskill	I don't accept surrender.
c479_20_death_1	This isn't right...
c479_20_death_2	Aaah...
c479_20_drive	This is why I'm better than you.
c479_20_hit_1	Ugh!
c479_20_hit_2	Urk.
c479_20_hit_3	How careless!
c479_20_prskill	How could you not see this coming?
c479_20_skill	Don't you run away.
c479_20_spa	I've never wasted my time in a place like this.
c479_20_startbt	Let's get it over with.
c479_20_story1	There, that's my autograph. Please do me a favor\and leave this little interaction off of the internet.
c479_20_story2	Everything I make is top tier. It has to be.
c479_20_story3	I hate to say it, but Karen has a point.\Fine, I'll try to take a break here and there.
c479_20_true1	Kenzaki Karen? Ugh. How can you compare me to someone with zero skill\who bought her way into the fencing team?
c479_20_true2	A hobby... I've never thought about anything other than fencing.\It's been everything to me.
c479_20_true3	I'll try to love myself more from now on. Thank you\for teaching me that I don't always have to be the best.
c479_20_victory	That was interesting.
c479_boss_long	Don't let your guard down.
c479_boss_short	Let's do this.
c479_ctskill	You're a little...slow.
c479_death_1	I can't... give up...
c479_death_2	Impossible!
c479_drive	I'll show you what it is to be perfect.
c479_hit_1	Pffft, that's hilarious!
c479_hit_2	Enough!
c479_hit_3	Ugh!
c479_prskill	You're going to hurt yourself. Heh heh.
c479_skill	Boring.
c479_spa	I've never wasted my time in a place like this.
c479_startbt	Let's see what you've got.
c479_story1	Are you the type who relies on pure luck?\I can't stand people like that.
c479_story2	Everything I make is top tier. It has to be.
c479_story3	If I put my trust in them, I'll never get away\from this third-rate demon or this deteriorating bakery.
c479_true1	You can't become Archfiend doing what you do now,\which is practically nothing.
c479_true2	You need to analyze yourself accurately and objectively.\You can't win by being so soft and indecisive.
c479_true3	I'm the best. If anyone tries to go above me,\I'll trample them. I'll go beyond them one way or another.
c479_victory	How dull!
c480_00_boss_long	Stepping onto the field!
c480_00_boss_short	Nice to meet you! Teehee!
c480_00_ctskill	What do you think of my skills?
c480_00_death_1	Ack... See you next time...
c480_00_death_2	Hm...
c480_00_drive	Oh, it's my turn. Teehee!
c480_00_hit_1	Oopsie!
c480_00_hit_2	Oof!
c480_00_hit_3	Ngh.
c480_00_prskill	I'll try not to hurt you too badly.
c480_00_skill	Yah!
c480_00_spa	Whoa! I've never been to such a nice place!\Hey, want to come in and join me?
c480_00_startbt	Oui.
c480_00_story1	Thank you so much.\You made my day!
c480_00_story2	Holy cow! That's incredible!\Gosh, I love this place!
c480_00_story3	I want to become a perfect fencer\like Kiyomi.
c480_00_true1	My favorite player? \Kiyomi, of course! Teehee!
c480_00_true2	I want to be the best at what I do as an athlete,\but I also want to enjoy my life.
c480_00_true3	My parents, coaches, and friends... They all love me.\They're the reason I've become a fencer.
c480_00_victory	Well done, everyone!
c480_20_boss_long	What did I do wrong?
c480_20_boss_short	You'll regret this.
c480_20_ctskill	You haven't seen what I'm capable of!
c480_20_death_1	Ngh.
c480_20_death_2	I could have won...
c480_20_drive	I'm going to win no matter what!
c480_20_hit_1	Ahhh!
c480_20_hit_2	Ouch!
c480_20_hit_3	That's not very nice!
c480_20_prskill	I'm going to beat you!
c480_20_skill	Yah!
c480_20_spa	Whoa! I've never been to such a nice place!\Hey, want to come in and join me?
c480_20_startbt	Let's get started!
c480_20_story1	Kiyomi's spirit has entered my body.\Oh, gosh! That's so cool!
c480_20_story2	Everything's so perfect today.\It's as if the day is telling me I'm the champion!
c480_20_story3	I'm going to be a fencing champion like Kiyomi one day.
c480_20_true1	How come Kiyomi is so good at everything she does?\And why do I mess up everything I try?
c480_20_true2	I'm going to change! I'm going to work hard\to be as good as Kiyomi!
c480_20_true3	I may have been born with more than others,\but that doesn't mean I didn't work hard to get this far. I'll prove it.
c480_20_victory	Heh heh. I told you I'd win.
c480_boss_long	Tah-dah! Here comes the princess!
c480_boss_short	Nice to meet you all!
c480_ctskill	Get ready!
c480_death_1	Want to play again later?
c480_death_2	Ugh!
c480_drive	Trust me.
c480_hit_1	Ahhh!
c480_hit_2	Ouch!
c480_hit_3	Hmph!
c480_prskill	My turn, right? Teehee!
c480_skill	A-ha! I see an opening!
c480_spa	Whoa! I've never been to such a nice place!\Hey, want to come in and join me?
c480_startbt	Let's get started.
c480_story1	How cute! She was so excited\that she forgot to take her bread and drink!
c480_story2	All righty! Everything just looks so perfect.\I think I was destined to be born today. Teehee!
c480_story3	I wish I was decisive\and assertive like Maupin.
c480_true1	Hello, Mr. Demon! How do I look today?\I look pretty, right? Teehee!
c480_true2	Hm... The Archfiend Contest, huh? I really don't think you can win it.\Teehee! Why don't you just play with me?
c480_true3	Karen's so pretty! And she's so kind and good at fencing.\So lovely, too. Just like me! Teehee!
c480_victory	I win, as usual!
c481_00_boss_long	This is good material.
c481_00_boss_short	I don't know if I can do this.
c481_00_ctskill	This will make a good scene.
c481_00_death_1	What a downer...
c481_00_death_2	A darn shame!
c481_00_drive	I'm getting all kinds of creative inspiration!
c481_00_hit_1	Wasn't expecting that one.
c481_00_hit_2	That hurt!
c481_00_hit_3	You'll regret that.
c481_00_prskill	This is how you do it, right?
c481_00_skill	Nice!
c481_00_spa	I'm getting inspiration... Here it comes...\Alright, I'm going to draw a demon enjoying a hot bath in Hell!
c481_00_startbt	Let's do this!
c481_00_story1	Hah hah. Stalking demons\is a very Takuro thing to do.
c481_00_story2	Please accept these flowers.\I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
c481_00_story3	I'm planning a get together for tonight to try to cheer him up.\Want to come?
c481_00_true1	I want to be with Wyatt forever.\I hope she feels the same way.
c481_00_true2	I have a feeling Takuro caused trouble again,\and my intuition is never wrong.
c481_00_true3	I want to make a cartoon about the Archfiend Contest...\I wonder if demons would approve of it.
c481_00_victory	That was a good experience.
c481_88_boss_long	Let's start this battle!
c481_88_boss_short	An admirable foe.
c481_88_bubble_prskill	I'll serve you something hot!
c481_88_bubble_skill	Can you handle this?
c481_88_ctskill	Let's see if you can handle this, too.
c481_88_death_1	Bah, such a rookie mistake!
c481_88_death_2	Watch my back.
c481_88_drive	This is modern warfare!
c481_88_hit_1	Ouch!
c481_88_hit_2	You're annoying.
c481_88_hit_3	Oops!
c481_88_hit_4	Good job!
c481_88_hit_5	I've got this!
c481_88_hit_6	Oof!
c481_88_hit_7	Not yet!
c481_88_hit_8	Is that all?
c481_88_hit_9	Not so fast!
c481_88_prskill	I'll serve you something hot!
c481_88_skill	Can you handle this?
c481_boss_long	Hah hah hah!
c481_boss_short	Is that the best you can do?
c481_ctskill	Let's see if you can handle this, too.
c481_death_1	Bah, such a rookie mistake!
c481_death_2	Watch my back.
c481_drive	This is modern warfare!
c481_hit_1	That stings.
c481_hit_2	Not bad.
c481_hit_3	Urgh!
c481_prskill	I'll destroy you all!
c481_skill	Want to see some fireworks?
c481_spa	Ah, that hit the spot! I commend you this time.
c481_startbt	I'll wipe you out!
c481_story1	Hey, Takuro. Are you...\standing on a controller? It's downright totaled.
c481_story2	He really wants to tell me how he feels...\Dang it, I don't know what to do.
c481_story3	Right now, you're investing time and effort in yourself\to be successful in life. Keep it together!
c481_true1	I expected counterfire warfare and got a fanzine instead.\I'm disappointed, but I'm not about to ignore comrades in trouble.
c481_true2	I want to let off some steam sometimes.\Where can I find someone to run some drills with?
c481_true3	The Archfiend Contest, huh? I bet it's really intense.\Camaraderie blooming in the midst of war—ah, how romantic!
c481_victory	I knew we'd win.
c482_00_boss_long	I call upon thee, powers of darkness that dwell deep within!
c482_00_boss_short	The time has come for the majestic might of the dark dragon to manifest!
c482_00_ctskill	The power... It surges from within!
c482_00_death_1	Burning it all... to pure white.
c482_00_death_2	How could I... be defeated.
c482_00_drive	Begone beyond the most jet night!
c482_00_hit_1	Gahn!
c482_00_hit_2	Stop this violence! Quit it!
c482_00_hit_3	I-I don't have any money!
c482_00_prskill	You shall have a taste of my power!
c482_00_skill	The appointed time draws near!
c482_00_spa	We're being emotionally naked, right?\Let's have an honest heart to heart.
c482_00_startbt	The time has come to unleash this right hand of mine!
c482_00_story1	No, she was born from a pact with a demon.\She is as an angel fallen from Heaven!
c482_00_story2	W-Waaait!\Theophanooo!\Hear me out just this once, pleeease!
c482_00_story3	Wait, wait... I can still eat.\*munch* *munch*\Theophano...\Tehehe!
c482_00_true1	You'd best believe when I make my debut, I'm going platinum! Hehehe!
c482_00_true2	I've finally found her--my ideal girl!\Theophano!\Be my girlfriend, pleeease!
c482_00_true3	Expressing my love to a figurine didn't work...\The wall scroll was a bust, too.\Next time, I'm gonna do it with a body pillow!
c482_00_victory	Hmph! Did you think that would be enough to defeat me?!
c482_boss_long	Hello, I'm Theophano!
c482_boss_short	Nice to see you!
c482_ctskill	Let me try!
c482_death_1	I really wanted to win...
c482_death_2	I'll do better next time.
c482_drive	This is incredible!
c482_hit_1	Ow, ow, that hurt!
c482_hit_2	I won't forget that!
c482_hit_3	Ngh. Meanie.
c482_prskill	And take this!
c482_skill	Knock, knock.
c482_spa	Why aren't there any fish in the hot spring? Isn't the hot spring water good for them as well?\...Excuse me? It'll cook them?
c482_startbt	I can dig in my heels when I have to.
c482_story1	Hmph. We are strictly friends. Nothing more!
c482_story2	That evil wolf cloud\is trying to eat the cute sheep cloud!
c482_story3	Oops, I did it again.\Sometimes I get my spices mixed up.
c482_true1	I shouldn't have a problem with someone who brought me into existence,\but I can't help but avoid my pactmaker. Ugh.
c482_true2	I wish I could touch the pretty moon in the sky. Oh! Maybe I can pick it up\if I follow it to the other side of the horizon!
c482_true3	Why doesn't it snow in the summer?\It'd be cool if it did?
c482_victory	I tried my best, Master!
c483_00_boss_long	Don't record me without asking!
c483_00_boss_short	That seems like a neat concept!
c483_00_ctskill	Don't cause any trouble!
c483_00_death_1	This is so messed up...
c483_00_death_2	It's over... It's all over...
c483_00_drive	This is, like, seriously a pain!
c483_00_hit_1	What?!
c483_00_hit_2	Eeek!
c483_00_hit_3	I could use some help here!
c483_00_prskill	Check this out. It's gonna be so cool!
c483_00_skill	Ugh, shut up!
c483_00_spa	Aaah... I feel so revitalized.
c483_00_startbt	Stronger than me, are you?\Nice big boy pants you got there!
c483_00_story1	If I were a burglar, there's no way I'd go into a house\with Takuro's photos all on display like that.
c483_00_story2	What if we made an album, too?\I'm sure it would be a lot of fun to do together!
c483_00_story3	What nice weather.\Days like these are perfect for cosplay photos.
c483_00_true1	I have a ton of characters I'd like to cosplay.\But it would probably take more than two lifetimes to do 'em all.
c483_00_true2	It'd be fun to do cosplay with a Child.\A shame people wouldn't be able to see them.
c483_00_true3	I finally planned a cosplay event just for it to rain.\This is the worst.\Hey, demon what are you doing?\Can't you manipulate the weather or something?
c483_00_victory	You shouldn't underestimate me.
c483_boss_long	This is nothing.
c483_boss_short	Are you taking this seriously right now?
c483_ctskill	Get out of the way.
c483_death_1	Not bad...
c483_death_2	The rest is in your hands.
c483_drive	Today is a day of victory!
c483_hit_1	Tch.
c483_hit_2	Cheeky.
c483_hit_3	How dare you?
c483_prskill	Give up your life!
c483_skill	How absurd.
c483_spa	Wow. This outdoor bath is quite nice.
c483_startbt	You think you can beat me?\That's a good one.
c483_story1	I want to turn it into an impregnable fortress,\but the demon said no. I have to settle for this.
c483_story2	You'd better not make my pactmaker cry,\or I'll make you cry blood!
c483_story3	How dare you\covet my pactmaker!\I'll shred you to pieces!
c483_true1	No matter how you look at it.\There's just no one cuter than my pactmaker.\She's the cutest girl in the universe.
c483_true2	I can't believe a demon participating in the Archfiend Contest\lives in such a sorry place.\What a disgrace.
c483_true3	Quit dawdling\and make more pacts. Even just one more.\Battles are won and lost by the size of the armies.
c483_victory	Raise a cry of victory.
c485_10_boss_long	Is fighting...the only way?
c485_10_boss_short	Are you lost?
c485_10_ctskill	Heehee, gotcha!
c485_10_death_1	Hehe... Too bad...
c485_10_death_2	I'm sorry... Red Cross...
c485_10_drive	Can you show me how you feel?
c485_10_hit_1	Oh?!
c485_10_hit_2	Oh, no...
c485_10_hit_3	Ngh!
c485_10_prskill	Do you trust me?
c485_10_skill	Let me help.
c485_10_spa	I haven't been able to take it easy in a long time.\Hehehe... I feel like it reminds me of something.
c485_10_startbt	Looking for me?
c485_10_story1	Right.\He's a really sweet little demon.\I'm sure he's waiting for us somewhere.
c485_10_story2	I'm not sure.\When I try to remember...\all I see is an empty darkness.
c485_10_story3	The less you're involved with demons, the better.
c485_10_true1	You can be weak. It's okay!\We'll take it as we go.\Even if you're defeated and get frustrated, you'll find the light someday.
c485_10_true2	You don't have to be afraid.\Fear only makes your world smaller.\Your world can be whatever it needs to be.\I just hope I can help you.
c485_10_true3	Sometimes even I don't know\what I'm thinking.\Have you ever felt like this?
c485_10_victory	It's okay. You can rest now.
c485_boss_long	You are not a lucky one.
c485_boss_short	Do you intend to beat me?
c485_ctskill	You might want to run away.
c485_death_1	Please...take care of Yuna...
c485_death_2	I can't see...the light...
c485_drive	I think I like you.
c485_hit_1	This is so boring.
c485_hit_2	Huh?
c485_hit_3	You seem confident.
c485_prskill	Can you move?
c485_skill	Shush.
c485_spa	Don't bother fussing about me much.\You won't get anything in return.
c485_startbt	I'm ready when you are.
c485_story1	I can't wait for you anymore.\You must be tired of waiting for me, too.
c485_story2	You're going to hear from me\if you plan to keep wasting Yuna's time with idle chit-chat.
c485_story3	The less you're involved with demons, the better.
c485_true1	Don't think about it so hard.\You have one simple choice:\To survive or to die.
c485_true2	Why are you so bent on bringing up awful memories?\It could be so much easier if you don't remember them.
c485_true3	Trust no one.\And only look out for yourself.\After all, when push comes to shove,\everyone runs away, leaving you behind.
c485_victory	Better than expected.
c486_10_boss_long	You're going to be my stepping-stone!
c486_10_boss_short	Let's get on with it, eh?!
c486_10_ctskill	Time for revenge!
c486_10_death_1	I don't believe this...
c486_10_death_2	So, this is what it comes to...
c486_10_drive	This might actually be fun!
c486_10_hit_1	Tch!
c486_10_hit_2	Excuse me?!
c486_10_hit_3	Hmph!
c486_10_prskill	You buncha greenhorns.
c486_10_skill	Rowdy little goons, aren't ya?
c486_10_spa	This hot spring's surprisingly lukewarm.\Can't it get any hotter?
c486_10_startbt	Let's have us some fun, eh?
c486_10_story1	So, this is the Universe Skill?\Hehe...hahaha! I dig it.\This is the power I had in my prime!
c486_10_story2	I'm sick of playing hide and seek.\Come back already, Babel.
c486_10_story3	When you get older...\you start to see things you didn't see before.
c486_10_true1	Accept your weakness.\Your first enemy is your own cowardice.
c486_10_true2	Being ready to die is something fools do.\You ever seen a demon what's scared of a dead lion?
c486_10_true3	Out with it.\What's your wish?\Is it revenge?\Do you beg for your life?
c486_10_victory	Well? Did you learn your lesson?!
c486_88_boss_long	Time to eat already?
c486_88_boss_short	Who's gonna win?
c486_88_bubble_prskill	Lemme give you a little test.
c486_88_bubble_skill	Bring it!
c486_88_ctskill	What's the point?
c486_88_death_1	I lose.\Bahaha!
c486_88_death_2	Gotta admit. You got me...
c486_88_drive	It's my time now!
c486_88_hit_1	Get outta my sight.
c486_88_hit_2	Got my attention.
c486_88_hit_3	Hm?
c486_88_hit_4	You're a pain in my rear.
c486_88_hit_5	Spunky.
c486_88_hit_6	Think you got what it takes?
c486_88_hit_7	I won't forget that!
c486_88_hit_8	Still not done?
c486_88_hit_9	What an idiot.
c486_88_prskill	Lemme give you a little test.
c486_88_skill	Bring it!
c486_89_boss_long	Time to eat already?
c486_89_boss_short	Who's gonna win?
c486_89_bubble_prskill	Lemme give you a little test.
c486_89_bubble_skill	Bring it!
c486_89_ctskill	What's the point?
c486_89_death_1	I lose.\Bahaha!
c486_89_death_2	Gotta admit. You got me...
c486_89_drive	It's my time now!
c486_89_hit_1	Get outta my sight.
c486_89_hit_2	Got my attention.
c486_89_hit_3	Hm?
c486_89_hit_4	You're a pain in my rear.
c486_89_hit_5	Spunky.
c486_89_hit_6	Think you got what it takes?
c486_89_hit_7	I won't forget that!
c486_89_hit_8	Still not done?
c486_89_hit_9	What an idiot.
c486_89_prskill	Lemme give you a little test.
c486_89_skill	Bring it!
c486_boss_long	Meeting me was your crime!
c486_boss_short	So, how did it feel to meet a queen?!
c486_ctskill	What's the point?
c486_death_1	I lose.\Bahaha!
c486_death_2	Gotta admit. You got me...
c486_drive	It's my time now!
c486_hit_1	Was that a joke?
c486_hit_2	Huh.
c486_hit_3	Gahaha!
c486_prskill	How about you just drop dead?
c486_skill	What a bore.
c486_spa	This hot spring's surprisingly lukewarm.\Can't it get any hotter?
c486_startbt	Watch me. You might learn something.
c486_story1	So, this is the Universe Skill?\Hehe...hahaha! I dig it.\This is the power I had in my prime!
c486_story2	I'm sick of playing hide and seek.\Come back already, Babel.
c486_story3	When you get older...\you start to see things you didn't see before.
c486_true1	I'm sick of you spineless cowards and your complaints!\If you've got demonic power then use it!\Show me you can fight and win!
c486_true2	You see 'em sometimes.\The kind of stupid demon that picks a fight they can't win.\Then again, even idiots can have luck on their side.
c486_true3	Still can't believe there was a demon out there who'd pick a fight with me.\Color me amused!
c486_victory	Let this regal glory get seared into your mind!
c488_00_boss_long	Hi, everyone's gathered!
c488_00_boss_short	Hello, there! Nice to meet you.
c488_00_ctskill	I'm not so sure about this, but...
c488_00_death_1	That could've gone better...
c488_00_death_2	Let's meet again.
c488_00_drive	Might as well go for the win, right?
c488_00_hit_1	Ngh...
c488_00_hit_2	I don't like pain.
c488_00_hit_3	It is just not my day.
c488_00_prskill	Over here!
c488_00_skill	Help me out!
c488_00_spa	It's been a while since the last time I just hung out in a hot spring.
c488_00_startbt	It's my turn to help this time.
c488_00_story1	Whoa, whoa! Calm down, Demon.\Being so stressed out isn't\good for your health.
c488_00_story2	I thought demons had easier lives than people.\Haha. It's nice living for something\you're devoted to, though.
c488_00_story3	It seems like the demon has a losing personality.\I've thought of letting him be, but it bugs me.
c488_00_true1	My grandma's really skilled with her hands.\She could've been a famous designer\if she'd been born a little later.
c488_00_true2	Thanks to Kurumi,\I discovered how fun cosplay can be.\Oh! Can't forget to thank you, too, Demon.
c488_00_true3	I want to make it up to Kurumi someday.\Ooh, maybe I'll get grandma to teach me how to sew.
c488_00_victory	Call on me if you ever need a helping hand.
c488_20_boss_long	Hahah. That's...actually a lot more than I expected.
c488_20_boss_short	Couldn't we just go one at a time? ...No?
c488_20_ctskill	Pow!
c488_20_death_1	Yeah... I'm taking off now...
c488_20_death_2	I'm so lame...
c488_20_drive	La dolce vita!
c488_20_hit_1	Ngh!
c488_20_hit_2	I need help!
c488_20_hit_3	Wait!
c488_20_prskill	M-Maybe if I bite 'em?
c488_20_skill	Mr. Demooon!
c488_20_spa	It's been a while since the last time I just hung out in a hot spring.
c488_20_startbt	C-Come at me!
c488_20_story1	Whoa, whoa! Calm down, Demon.\Being so stressed out isn't\good for your health.
c488_20_story2	I thought demons had easier lives than people.\Haha. It's nice spending your life\working on something, though.
c488_20_story3	It seems like the demon has a losing personality.\I've thought of letting him be but it bugs me.
c488_20_true1	This costume felt kind of wrong at first.\But it's slowly growing on me.
c488_20_true2	I want to keep doing cosplay with Kurumi.\I wonder which character I should do next.
c488_20_true3	I wouldn't have even discovered what my wish is\if I'd never met you.\Thank you, demon.
c488_20_victory	Oops. Guess I won.
c488_boss_long	The heck?! There are so many enemies!
c488_boss_short	I'm Dryad, you know!
c488_ctskill	Let's have some fun!
c488_death_1	I'm going on ahead...
c488_death_2	But I can...still fight...
c488_drive	I'm not doing chores!
c488_hit_1	Ow...
c488_hit_2	Don't hit me!
c488_hit_3	This is so annoying.
c488_prskill	It's not like I'm in your way.
c488_skill	Um, that really hurts.
c488_spa	Do you have anything I could eat while I soak in the bath?
c488_startbt	If I win, you're buying.
c488_story1	Why are you so unhappy all the time?\Being angry like that only\gives you gray hair.
c488_story2	You guys are so busy all the time...\Oh well,\that's none of my business.\All I need is your food and games.
c488_story3	Finders takers!\Game rules apply to life, too.\It's the Demon's fault for\hiding it in such an obvious place.
c488_true1	Guess what, demon.\I microwaved a hamburger...\but it came out cold!\...Uh, was that not funny?
c488_true2	Do you have a house where you can just lie down\and press a button to watch TV\and eat something tasty?
c488_true3	Hey, demon, I just had an awesome idea.\How about opening a huge fast food place\when you become the Archfiend?
c488_victory	My reward is potato chips!
c489_10_boss_long	Hah hah! Which one should I devour first?
c489_10_boss_short	Hello, friends!
c489_10_ctskill	I've got you!
c489_10_death_1	I'll get out of your hair now.
c489_10_death_2	How I hate being so quiet.
c489_10_drive	Let's play, shall we?
c489_10_hit_1	Temper, temper.
c489_10_hit_2	Oopsy-daisy!
c489_10_hit_3	How irritating.
c489_10_prskill	Are you certain?
c489_10_skill	Hah hah hah!
c489_10_spa	I've never seen such a small bath before...\Well, I suppose it doesn't matter.
c489_10_startbt	You shouldn't trust me.
c489_10_story1	I will return to you.\Until then, forget me not, Semele.
c489_10_story2	That's strange. You humans are filled with desires.\Ohh, now I see. You're stupid.
c489_10_story3	I was so excited to have a new family.\I'm sorry this happened.
c489_10_true1	This world is filled with fascinating things.\You ignorant fools can barely even fathom their number.
c489_10_true2	Life is boring, wouldn't you say? Why don't you come with me?\Wherever we go, it'll be better than being here.
c489_10_true3	We demons don't really grant wishes?\Who told you that? Just ask me anything. I'll be your god.
c489_10_victory	All right, it's time I collected my payment.
c489_11_boss_long	Ta-da! Here comes your lovely Loki!
c489_11_boss_short	All right. Who's first?
c489_11_ctskill	Stop annoying me!
c489_11_death_1	Oops. I missed.
c489_11_death_2	Hah hah ha, hah hah...
c489_11_drive	Dance, Coppelia!
c489_11_hit_1	Ah hah hah! Hah hah!
c489_11_hit_2	You're rousing a giant.
c489_11_hit_3	Mm?
c489_11_prskill	All right, gather around.
c489_11_skill	Want to be friends?
c489_11_spa	I've never seen such a small bath before...\Well, I suppose it doesn't matter.
c489_11_startbt	This had better be a good fight.
c489_11_story1	I will return to you.\Until then, forget me not, Semele.
c489_11_story2	That's strange. You humans are filled with desires.\Ohh, now I see. You're stupid.
c489_11_story3	I was so excited to have a new family.\I'm sorry this happened.
c489_11_true1	I heard misfortune snowballs.\I wonder how big your snowball of misfortune will grow.
c489_11_true2	I wasn't always a black sheep, you know.\Hah hah. You don't really believe that, do you?
c489_11_true3	Why are you so scared? Hah hah! Let's be friends.\I like you. Don't you like me?
c489_11_victory	Ah hah hah! This is fun!
c489_87_boss_long	Whoa, what? Why are you so angry?
c489_87_boss_short	Tag! You're "It"!
c489_87_bubble_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_87_bubble_skill	Ta-da!
c489_87_ctskill	Oh, you poor thing. Hah hah hah!
c489_87_death_1	What the...? You live, you learn.
c489_87_death_2	I've had enough of this. I'm leaving.
c489_87_drive	This is what a king can do.
c489_87_hit_1	Ah hah hah.
c489_87_hit_2	What the...?
c489_87_hit_3	Do you want to play?
c489_87_hit_4	Yeah, yeah.
c489_87_hit_5	Come on!
c489_87_hit_6	Lighten up!
c489_87_hit_7	Hah hah hah.
c489_87_hit_8	You're kind of annoying.
c489_87_hit_9	Stop bullying me!
c489_87_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_87_skill	This is what a king can do.
c489_88_boss_long	Whoa, what? Why are you so angry?
c489_88_boss_short	Tag! You're "It"!
c489_88_bubble_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_88_bubble_skill	Ta-da!
c489_88_ctskill	Oh, you poor thing. Hah hah hah!
c489_88_death_1	What the...? You live, you learn.
c489_88_death_2	I've had enough of this. I'm leaving.
c489_88_drive	This is what a king can do.
c489_88_hit_1	Ah hah hah.
c489_88_hit_2	What the...?
c489_88_hit_3	Do you want to play?
c489_88_hit_4	Yeah, yeah.
c489_88_hit_5	Come on!

c489_88_hit_8	You're kind of annoying.
c489_88_hit_9	Stop bullying me!
c489_88_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_88_skill	This is what a king can do.
c489_89_boss_long	Whoa, what? Why are you so angry?
c489_89_boss_short	Tag! You're "It"!
c489_89_bubble_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_89_bubble_skill	Ta-da!
c489_89_ctskill	Oh, you poor thing. Hah hah hah!
c489_89_death_1	What the...? You live, you learn.
c489_89_death_2	I've had enough of this. I'm leaving.
c489_89_drive	This is what a king can do.
c489_89_hit_1	Ah hah hah.
c489_89_hit_2	What the...?
c489_89_hit_3	Do you want to play?
c489_89_hit_4	Yeah, yeah.

c489_89_prskill	Now, for a change of mood!
c489_89_skill	This is what a king can do.
c489_boss_long	I commend you for your hard work!
c489_boss_short	I've been waiting. Ah hah hah.
c489_ctskill	Oh, you poor thing. Hah hah hah!
c489_death_1	What the...? You live, you learn.
c489_death_2	I've had enough of this. I'm leaving.
c489_drive	All right. Let's dance.
c489_hit_1	Hah hah hah. Honestly?
c489_hit_2	How rude!
c489_hit_3	I'm disappointed in you.
c489_prskill	Let's get this over with.
c489_skill	Want to play with me?
c489_spa	I've never seen such a small bath before...\Well, I suppose it doesn't matter.
c489_startbt	Let the crusade begin!
c489_story1	I will return to you.\Until then, forget me not, Semele.
c489_story2	That's strange. You humans are filled with desires.\Ohh, now I see. You're stupid.
c489_story3	I was so excited to have a new family.\I'm sorry this happened.
c489_true1	What do you want to know?\A secret, sad past?
c489_true2	Have you heard of the "Parable of the Bramble"?\The thornbush released fire, consuming all the trees in the world.
c489_true3	Under my rule, the world will be delightful.\I'm going to change everything, from beginning to end.
c489_victory	This is what a king can do.
c493_00_boss_long	Wanna hear about outer space?
c493_00_boss_short	Ever heard of dark matter?
c493_00_ctskill	Do you want to go stargazing with me?
c493_00_death_1	I wanted to learn more about space...
c493_00_death_2	Is this... a black hole?
c493_00_drive	Isn't the explosion of a supernova breathtaking?
c493_00_hit_1	Eeep!
c493_00_hit_2	Could you stop?!
c493_00_hit_3	Whoa!
c493_00_prskill	Outer space doesn't interest you?
c493_00_skill	How many stars do you think there are?
c493_00_spa	I'd never been to a hot spring before!\Oh, that reminds me...\Did you know they discovered hot springs on Saturn's moons?
c493_00_startbt	Have you heard of the planet Putena?
c493_00_story1	Putena isn't just made up!\It's been proven a real planet by science!
c493_00_story2	I'll prove Putena exists before you finish writing your novel.\No matter what it takes!
c493_00_story3	I wonder if I got along with my mother when I was little.\And what she was like...
c493_00_true1	Saturn has 0.7 times the density of water.\That means if you put it in water,\it'd float on it like polystyrene foam!\Haha! Isn't that fascinating?
c493_00_true2	I'm just saying what pops into my head.\Other people don't seem that interested, though.\Then again, I do mostly talk about space.
c493_00_true3	The planet Putena really exists!\And I've got proof!\I'll show it to you in my room!
c493_00_victory	Space is outta this world!
c493_88_boss_long	I won't tolerate rebellion.
c493_88_boss_short	Come at me.
c493_88_bubble_prskill	Time to end this.
c493_88_bubble_skill	Get ready!
c493_88_ctskill	I'll end you.
c493_88_death_1	Ngh...
c493_88_death_2	Urgh... Protect our citizens...
c493_88_drive	For the glory of Putena!
c493_88_hit_1	Charge!
c493_88_hit_2	Hah...!
c493_88_hit_3	Ngh...
c493_88_hit_4	Drat!
c493_88_hit_5	Bah!
c493_88_hit_6	I can't lose!
c493_88_hit_7	No excuses!
c493_88_hit_8	It's not over yet.
c493_88_hit_9	This isn't over.
c493_88_prskill	Time to end this.
c493_88_skill	Get ready!
c493_boss_long	I'll punish you Rebels.
c493_boss_short	Bring it on!
c493_ctskill	I'll end you.
c493_death_1	Ngh...
c493_death_2	Urgh... Protect our citizens...
c493_drive	For the glory of Putena!
c493_hit_1	Ooof!
c493_hit_2	Guh!
c493_hit_3	Never!
c493_prskill	I've been waiting for this moment!
c493_skill	Don't expect mercy from me.
c493_spa	There are so many strange things on Earth...\Hey, what are you doing? Turn around.
c493_startbt	I'm going to reclaim my empire.
c493_story1	They're liars, too.\Definitely Rebels.
c493_story2	I must stay with Kirara until we find\a way back to Putena.
c493_story3	What do I do? I'm alone with Mother.\Was I close to her when I was young?
c493_true1	Did you think all princesses wore a dress\and sat on a shiny throne?
c493_true2	I'm the Princess of Putena.\I'll punish the despicable traitors and build a new empire.
c493_true3	I'm sorry I mistook you for a Rebel. When I return\to Putena, I'll see you're rewarded.
c493_victory	We won!
c494_00_boss_long	What should we talk about today?
c494_00_boss_short	Welcome.
c494_00_ctskill	Got anything fun to talk about?
c494_00_death_1	It's okay... Don't worry about me...
c494_00_death_2	Ack... I messed up...
c494_00_drive	I think I could write the best story ever!
c494_00_hit_1	Eeep!
c494_00_hit_2	Ugh...
c494_00_hit_3	Sheesh.
c494_00_prskill	Seems interesting, right?
c494_00_skill	Are you all right?
c494_00_spa	My, my.\I'd never been to such a fabulous hot spring before.\I'll be using it as reference for my novel.\Ehehe.
c494_00_startbt	Seems kind of fun.
c494_00_story1	Kirara's such a little prankster.\But you know what? She gets totally serious when she talks about the novel.
c494_00_story2	I can't be Kirara's mother,\but I'd love to be by her side forever.
c494_00_story3	Kirara's eyes used to sparkle when she was little.\She was the cutest when talking about Putena.
c494_00_true1	Oh no!\I must seem so childish...\Maybe it's because I'm always talking to Kirara.
c494_00_true2	Kirara's got talent.\I just know she has what it takes to be an amazing novelist.
c494_00_true3	I'd rather be known as a novelist, not the youngest professor.\I'm sure I could do it if I stuck with Kirara.
c494_00_victory	Nailed it.
c494_boss_long	Let's not fight.
c494_boss_short	Nice to see you.
c494_ctskill	Everything will be okay.
c494_death_1	Messier...
c494_death_2	Please, bury me in Putena...
c494_drive	Shall we dance?
c494_hit_1	Ouch!
c494_hit_2	Ngh...
c494_hit_3	Whew...
c494_prskill	I can hear someone singing.
c494_skill	Ow, that must hurt.
c494_spa	Hmm ha hoo huh hmm! ♬ I can't stop humming.\This hot spring on Earth is so pleasant.
c494_startbt	What a beautiful place!
c494_story1	Ho ho! You're such imps.\I used to sing my little princess to sleep.
c494_story2	I'm a mother.\I can't be weak in front of children...
c494_story3	The Rosanna you know... I see.\I was so busy taking care of my Princess that I neglected you.
c494_true1	When I was in Putena, no one was hungry\or sad. Now... I can't go back to that Putena, can I?
c494_true2	I loved His Majesty with all my heart. I didn't care\about being empress... This is all my fault.
c494_true3	Messier is just like her father. She seems stern,\but she's delicate on the inside. Please, be kind to her.
c494_victory	I won.
c495_00_boss_long	Bring it!
c495_00_boss_short	Could I actually win?
c495_00_ctskill	Easy peasy!
c495_00_death_1	Meooow!
c495_00_death_2	Urgh... I'm done for...
c495_00_drive	Kitty... punch!
c495_00_hit_1	Mew!
c495_00_hit_2	Mreow...
c495_00_hit_3	Meanie.
c495_00_prskill	What a dummy.
c495_00_skill	Don't ignore me!
c495_00_spa	You said you were taking me somewhere nice\but you lied!\What are you trying to do?\Boil me alive to eat me?!
c495_00_startbt	What's the matter?\Are you so scared you're shaking?
c495_00_story1	Master!\I had fun running!
c495_00_story2	The weather's so good. It's perfect for going on a walk!\Let's go find something interesting!
c495_00_story3	It smells so delightful.\How could I not eat it?!
c495_00_true1	*sigh*\What a purrfectly happy life.\Wonder if Poppy's happy with a new master, too.
c495_00_true2	Meow, meow, meow...\Where to go today?\Hey! Something smells yummy!\Where's it coming from?
c495_00_true3	Maybe I can't see Poppy everyday like I used to...\But she's still my best friend!
c495_00_victory	Did my kitty punch hurt or what?
c495_boss_long	Let's play tag!
c495_boss_short	Hee hee hee!
c495_ctskill	I can do it!
c495_death_1	I'm just gonna...take a lil' nyap here.
c495_death_2	Meow nooo... I tried so hard...
c495_drive	Kitties' claws hurt, u know!
c495_hit_1	Meanie!
c495_hit_2	Mew mew!
c495_hit_3	You're a baddie!
c495_prskill	Time for a walk!
c495_skill	Here I go!
c495_spa	You said you were taking me somewhere nice\but you lied!\What are you trying to do?\Boil me alive to eat me?!
c495_startbt	You'll have a hard time if you're not careful.
c495_story1	Master!\I had fun running!
c495_story2	The weather's so good. It's perfect for going on a walk!\Let's go find something interesting!
c495_story3	It smells so delightful.\How could I not eat it?!
c495_true1	What's this?\How does that work?\The Mortal Realm's just full of mysteries,\isn't it Master?!
c495_true2	Master!\Next time, let's go on a walk up the Mortal...\no, the Infernal Realm's tallest mountain!
c495_true3	Master, if you become Archfiend,\you should build Meow Meow Land!\You gotta make it so people can laze about\and take midday naps!
c495_victory	That's what you get when you're not careful!
c496_00_boss_long	Let's play!
c496_00_boss_short	So cool!
c496_00_ctskill	I'll help.
c496_00_death_1	Sorry I... wasn't helpful...
c496_00_death_2	*whine*...
c496_00_drive	Yay!\Let's play tag!
c496_00_hit_1	Ack. I messed up!
c496_00_hit_2	Yipe...
c496_00_hit_3	I'm okay!
c496_00_prskill	I got this!
c496_00_skill	Awooo!
c496_00_spa	Master!\What a fabulous pool!\What?!\You can't swim in here?
c496_00_startbt	You called?
c496_00_story1	Ahh, this feels so good!\The air's delicious. The sun's warm.\Nothing like going for a walk.
c496_00_story2	This master is the sweetest in all the world!
c496_00_story3	Should we play a game, Master?\Just thinking about it makes me so excited!
c496_00_true1	Life at the shelter was hard,\but I could take it\because Silk was always there with me.
c496_00_true2	Nothing makes me happier\than being loved.\I want to make someone happy, too!
c496_00_true3	I wish I could see Silk.\Wonder where she is right now.\Is she as free as a cloud?
c496_00_victory	I did it, Master!
c496_boss_long	I'll do my very best.
c496_boss_short	Let's do this.
c496_ctskill	Watch this!
c496_death_1	I'm sorry...
c496_death_2	Did I...help?
c496_drive	Shall we put an end to this?
c496_hit_1	Ow wow wow...
c496_hit_2	I'm fine.
c496_hit_3	I can still fight!
c496_prskill	You won't get past me.
c496_skill	No need to worry about me.
c496_spa	Master!\What a fabulous pool!\What?!\You can't swim in here?
c496_startbt	Awaiting orders, Master!
c496_story1	Ahh, this feels so good!\The air's delicious. The sun's warm.\Nothing like going for a walk.
c496_story2	Why don't we all play tag?\I'll be It!
c496_story3	Should we play a game, Master?\Just thinking about it makes me so excited!
c496_true1	What can I do to make Master happy?\I know! We should go on a walk together!\They're so fun. It's bound to make him happy!
c496_true2	I'm so glad Poppy\found a good owner.\Oh Archie, you're gonna be so happy now.
c496_true3	Master's a demon\but he said he doesn't wanna be the Archfiend.\I knew was kindhearted.
c496_victory	I was a good girl, right?
c497_10_boss_long	You should surrender while you can.
c497_10_boss_short	Welcome!
c497_10_ctskill	You don't know what you're doing.
c497_10_death_1	What a bummer!
c497_10_death_2	I didn't know this was coming...
c497_10_drive	This is it!
c497_10_hit_1	Move it!
c497_10_hit_2	Is this it?
c497_10_hit_3	Ngh...
c497_10_prskill	Let's see who wins, shall we?
c497_10_skill	Boring!
c497_10_spa	When did you prepare such a nice event?\Alright, what do you want? What do you want to look like?
c497_10_startbt	What can I do for you?
c497_10_story1	Yes, I'm a genius! Otherwise, I couldn't have\sculpted as perfect a face as this!
c497_10_story2	I've been looking for a decent model,\but to no avail. Can you recommend someone?
c497_10_story3	You can create a new world just by imagining it.\Isn't that amazing?
c497_10_true1	Art reflects one's inner thoughts and imagination.\Only you humans can create art.
c497_10_true2	I go to church when I feel lost.\Art there often gives me inspiration.
c497_10_true3	Am I having creator's block? I feel so stagnant.\Maybe I should sell my soul to the Devil.
c497_10_victory	Good job!
c497_boss_long	I've been waiting for this!
c497_boss_short	You're not scared, are you?
c497_ctskill	Use your brain.
c497_death_1	Dang, that was for nothing...
c497_death_2	Hah hah, congrats...
c497_drive	Where do you think you're going?
c497_hit_1	Oooh!
c497_hit_2	You're good.
c497_hit_3	So obvious.
c497_prskill	I've got an idea.
c497_skill	Don't try too hard.
c497_spa	When did you prepare such a nice event?\Alright, what do you want? What do you want to look like?
c497_startbt	Here comes Methuselah's familiar!
c497_story1	I'm going to melt my soul to eliminate impurities.\I can change if I train my mind.
c497_story2	Hmpf! Don't act as if you're better than me. You're the one\who spent all our rent money gambling.
c497_story3	While I studied until my brain felt broken,\you gambled and even signed some kind of waiver for money?
c497_true1	Methuselah told me about you.\You're better than I thought.
c497_true2	Methuselah is a wicked demon.\I knew that and still agreed to be with him.
c497_true3	Okay, I admit. I belong\with Methuselah. It's infuriating, but there's nothing I can do about it.
c497_victory	You're glad you called me, aren't you?
c498_10_boss_long	Whatever.
c498_10_boss_short	What a pain in the ass...
c498_10_ctskill	Get lost!
c498_10_death_1	The hell...
c498_10_death_2	That was heavy...
c498_10_drive	Try this! Oraaaaagh!
c498_10_hit_1	Ugah!
c498_10_hit_2	Ngh.
c498_10_hit_3	Shit.
c498_10_prskill	Volcanic Viper!
c498_10_skill	Gun Flame!
c498_10_spa	A hot spring?\Water seems a bit tepid, but hey, I'll take a break.
c498_10_startbt	You'd better go all-out right from the start.
c498_10_story1	Thought I'd let myself in.
c498_10_story2	We're visitors! No invitation, though!
c498_10_story3	Just thought I'd take care of it while I was on my other business.\They offered a fat reward, too.
c498_10_true1	What a pain.\Gotta find a way to get everybody back all at once.
c498_10_true2	This ain't the Backyard... This place...\Looks like I'm gonna have to look around and find out.
c498_10_true3	Jack-O's here, too?\Knowing her, she's probably fine... But I should try to find her.
c498_10_victory	Spare me the headache and stay down.
c498_87_boss_long	Hope you've said your prayers.
c498_87_boss_short	Let's go.
c498_87_bubble_prskill	Say goodnight!
c498_87_bubble_skill	You done talking?
c498_87_ctskill	Get lost!
c498_87_death_1	The hell...
c498_87_death_2	That was heavy...
c498_87_drive	Sorry, you're done.
c498_87_hit_1	Guogh!
c498_87_hit_2	Nuah!
c498_87_hit_3	Ugh!
c498_87_hit_4	Dammit.
c498_87_hit_5	Tch.
c498_87_hit_6	Shit...!
c498_87_hit_7	You--!
c498_87_hit_8	Ugah!
c498_87_hit_9	Get lost.
c498_87_prskill	Say goodnight!
c498_boss_long	Whatever.
c498_boss_short	What a pain in the ass...
c498_ctskill	Get lost!
c498_death_1	The hell...
c498_death_2	That was heavy...
c498_drive	Try this! Oraaaaagh!
c498_hit_1	Ugah!
c498_hit_2	Ngh.
c498_hit_3	Shit.
c498_prskill	Volcanic Viper!
c498_skill	Gun Flame!
c498_spa	A hot spring?\Water seems a bit tepid, but hey, I'll take a break.
c498_startbt	You'd better go all-out right from the start.
c498_story1	Thought I'd let myself in.
c498_story2	We're visitors! No invitation, though!
c498_story3	Just thought I'd take care of it while I was on my other business.\They offered a fat reward, too.
c498_true1	What a pain.\Gotta find a way to get everybody back all at once.
c498_true2	This ain't the Backyard... This place...\Looks like I'm gonna have to look around and find out.
c498_true3	Jack-O's here, too?\Knowing her, she's probably fine... But I should try to find her.
c498_victory	Spare me the headache and stay down.
c499_boss_long	I'll create... the future.
c499_boss_short	If you're done talking, let's begin.
c499_ctskill	Smash.
c499_death_1	Poor judgment.
c499_death_2	I acknowledge my defeat.
c499_drive	Sear through! Calvados.
c499_hit_1	Kh.
c499_hit_2	Uh, kh...
c499_hit_3	Hurts.
c499_prskill	Surrender!
c499_skill	Pierce.
c499_spa	I've never been to a place that made me feel like this.
c499_startbt	I'll do my best. Really.
c499_story1	Good luck.
c499_story2	When I can't see them, I get very lonely.\I never used to feel this way when I was alone.
c499_story3	It's true I get lonely...\But, this is probably a good loneliness.
c499_true1	I need to find a way to return to my world.
c499_true2	This world is inhabited by demons.\I wonder if there is one like Lucifaro.
c499_true3	Davi, Mona, Lisa, they're all... kind.\I will not forget what it meant for me to come here.
c499_victory	This meant something, but I don't know what. So I'll keep going.
c500_boss_long	You can run... I won't mind.
c500_boss_short	You won't even have the time to blink.
c500_ctskill	Weak.
c500_death_1	I screwed up...
c500_death_2	You pass...
c500_drive	Playtime's over.
c500_hit_1	Kgh.
c500_hit_2	Tss.
c500_hit_3	No--!
c500_prskill	Eyes on me.
c500_skill	Slow.
c500_spa	It's not so bad taking a nice break like this\every once in a while.
c500_startbt	Win before you bark.
c500_story1	Well, then... I'll be expecting proper instruction.
c500_story2	A girl's hair is her life.\Especially, for ones like us.
c500_story3	Very well. So long as I'm in this world...\I'll help you.
c500_true1	When given a task, I see it to completion.\I'll do the same for you, little man.
c500_true2	Is there anyone with a backbone here?
c500_true3	Wait for me, everyone.\I will return.
c500_victory	You really weren't that bad, I guess.
c501_10_boss_long	I hear the wailing and surrender of my enemies.
c501_10_boss_short	Let's take a look.
c501_10_ctskill	The heat of battle is great.
c501_10_death_1	How futile!
c501_10_death_2	Hah hah! How insolent!
c501_10_drive	Fire is my savior!
c501_10_hit_1	Get out!
c501_10_hit_2	Seriously?
c501_10_hit_3	Try again.
c501_10_prskill	What gnats.
c501_10_skill	Need help?
c501_10_spa	You sure this is hot enough?\Let me heat it up some more with my fire.
c501_10_startbt	Hum trum raksa raksa mam.
c501_10_story1	You're too honest for your own good.\Others might try to take advantage of you.
c501_10_story2	You know better than that.\She has to face her problems and come to terms with them on her own.
c501_10_story3	Although faint, I can sense evil energy.\There are demons nearby.
c501_10_true1	Eat, play, do everything else you want to do. Life isn't that long.\Time flies faster like an arrow.
c501_10_true2	Arhat, don't doubt yourself.\Forget your past and focus on your present.
c501_10_true3	When your anger is extinguished, your eyes will be brightened.\Only then, you'll be able to see what you've lost.
c501_10_victory	Oṃ Amideva Hrīḥ.
c501_11_boss_long	This is meaningless in the end.
c501_11_boss_short	I don't even care anymore.
c501_11_ctskill	Worthless.
c501_11_death_1	This should bring... some peace...
c501_11_death_2	I can finally rest...
c501_11_drive	This is a bore. Let's get it over with.
c501_11_hit_1	Oh...
c501_11_hit_2	Ow...
c501_11_hit_3	That is hard enough.
c501_11_prskill	You can't bring yourself to care either, can you?
c501_11_skill	A meaningless attack, perhaps.
c501_11_spa	Mankind, do you know whence you came?\Where you are headed?
c501_11_startbt	Do you still have business with me?
c501_11_story1	Hmph. How quaint.\A demon and an aide caring for each other.
c501_11_story2	Hahaha...\The body becomes inebriated, but the heart does not,\so what is there left to do but drink on?
c501_11_story3	Hey, could you speak amongst yourselves outside?\My head is pounding...
c501_11_true1	I used to have friends like that.\Tch...
c501_11_true2	A drink for how pathetic I am.\Another tipple for how much I hate the world.\And a final dram to remember the people I miss.
c501_11_true3	Arhat, Nirrti, Keika... I wish I could see their faces.
c501_11_victory	Another day in this meaningless life...
c501_87_boss_long	I will not be driven forth from my post.
c501_87_boss_short	Hear the cries of Hell?
c501_87_bubble_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_87_bubble_skill	Hum trum.
c501_87_ctskill	With respect to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
c501_87_death_1	Even if I fell into a lonely sea...
c501_87_death_2	Life is an ordeal all on its own.
c501_87_drive	Inferno!
c501_87_hit_1	Stupid.
c501_87_hit_2	Again?
c501_87_hit_3	You've sinned.
c501_87_hit_4	Hah hah!
c501_87_hit_5	Still?
c501_87_hit_6	Shoo!
c501_87_hit_7	Oh, well.
c501_87_hit_8	Not bad.
c501_87_hit_9	Begone!
c501_87_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_87_skill	Hum trum.
c501_88_boss_long	I will not be driven forth from my post.
c501_88_boss_short	Hear the cries of Hell?
c501_88_bubble_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_88_bubble_skill	Hum trum.
c501_88_ctskill	With respect to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
c501_88_death_1	Even if I fell into a lonely sea...
c501_88_death_2	Life is an ordeal all on its own.
c501_88_drive	Inferno!
c501_88_hit_1	Stupid.
c501_88_hit_2	Again?
c501_88_hit_3	You've sinned.
c501_88_hit_4	Hah hah!
c501_88_hit_5	Still?
c501_88_hit_6	Shoo!
c501_88_hit_7	Oh, well.
c501_88_hit_8	Not bad.
c501_88_hit_9	Begone!
c501_88_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_88_skill	Hum trum.
c501_89_boss_long	I will not be driven forth from my post.
c501_89_boss_short	Hear the cries of Hell?
c501_89_bubble_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_89_bubble_skill	Hum trum.
c501_89_ctskill	With respect to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
c501_89_death_1	Even if I fell into a lonely sea...
c501_89_death_2	Life is an ordeal all on its own.
c501_89_drive	Inferno!
c501_89_hit_1	Stupid.
c501_89_hit_2	Again?
c501_89_hit_3	You've sinned.
c501_89_hit_4	Hah hah!
c501_89_hit_5	Still?
c501_89_hit_6	Shoo!
c501_89_hit_7	Oh, well.
c501_89_hit_8	Not bad.
c501_89_hit_9	Begone!
c501_89_prskill	Blaze up, blaze up!
c501_89_skill	Hum trum.
c501_boss_long	Devil's servants, begone!
c501_boss_short	Silence!
c501_ctskill	With respect to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!
c501_death_1	Even if I fell into a lonely sea...
c501_death_2	Life is an ordeal all on its own.
c501_drive	Inferno!
c501_hit_1	Tsk.
c501_hit_2	What?
c501_hit_3	What the...?
c501_prskill	Still strong, aren't you?
c501_skill	Dear Avalokiteshvara.
c501_spa	You sure this is hot enough?\Let me heat it up some more with my fire.
c501_startbt	Look at this rabble.
c501_story1	You're too honest for your own good.\Others might try to take advantage of you.
c501_story2	You know better than that.\She has to face her problems and come to terms with them on her own.
c501_story3	Although faint, I can sense evil energy.\There are demons nearby.
c501_true1	Attachment and anger come from the same place.\And they aren't the only feelings that come from there, either.
c501_true2	Don't fight the tide too much. The skein of your fate\was woven long ago. Just follow it. You'll be happiest that way.
c501_true3	When your mind is a tangled mess, it shows on your face.\Try to hide it all you want. You'll never succeed.
c501_victory	I haven't had so much fun in a long time.
c502_10_boss_long	Who's this clown?
c502_10_boss_short	You want to fight me?
c502_10_ctskill	Follow me to the Gates of Death!
c502_10_death_1	Good for you.
c502_10_death_2	I'll curse you for eternity.
c502_10_drive	Dear gods! Oh, dear gods!
c502_10_hit_1	I like it.
c502_10_hit_2	Are you just going to watch?
c502_10_hit_3	Gentle!
c502_10_prskill	Think you can beat me?
c502_10_skill	Hah hah hah!
c502_10_spa	What's this commotion? Evil spirits,\stop yammering and be gone from this place!
c502_10_startbt	Come forth!
c502_10_story1	Why don't you ask your teacher for\another suppression ritual instead?
c502_10_story2	Foolish humans, why do you struggle so hard to survive?\In the end, the result is the same. You die. Ah haha!
c502_10_story3	Alas! If only I had a living body like yours...\Well, I can't fool you, can I? Teehee!
c502_10_true1	Being dead isn't so bad. Be honest with me,\you're tired of living, aren't you? No? Hee hee! Okay!
c502_10_true2	Foolish Keika, how long is she\going to depend on Ragaraja?
c502_10_true3	You have to die to learn that life is futile...\Just like I did. Hah hah...
c502_10_victory	It was good you called me, wasn't it?
c502_boss_long	Did you make a reservation?
c502_boss_short	Sri sri maha sri su sri svaha!
c502_ctskill	Protect the Gate!
c502_death_1	I hate pain...
c502_death_2	Waah! Teacher!
c502_drive	Evil spirits, begone! Begone at once!
c502_hit_1	I'm okay!
c502_hit_2	This isn't easy.
c502_hit_3	Urgh!
c502_prskill	Go! Go far away!
c502_skill	Evil spirits, go away!
c502_spa	Whew, thank you.\I feel as if I'm on vacation.
c502_startbt	Holy Spirit, bless me!
c502_story1	Alright, let me check your Pillars of Destiny.\Please, tell me your name and date of birth.
c502_story2	My teacher said it's your\mind that attracts demons.
c502_story3	To save face?\She never cares about what others think.
c502_true1	I think living is more important than anything else.\We placate the dead for our own peace of mind, don't we?
c502_true2	Since Teacher saved me, she seeks to take advantage\of me every chance she gets. She knows I can't refuse.
c502_true3	Sometimes I ask the gods why they've chosen\me as their agent. So far, they haven't answered me.
c502_victory	May you rest in peace.
c503_10_boss_long	Don't you want to play with me?
c503_10_boss_short	The water sure feels nice, doesn't it?
c503_10_ctskill	Do you want me to fan you?
c503_10_death_1	The valleys of Hell, hotter than summer...
c503_10_death_2	Scattering in futility is the final journey...
c503_10_drive	Let's enjoy the summer.
c503_10_hit_1	Aah!
c503_10_hit_2	Excuse me!
c503_10_hit_3	Ngh!
c503_10_prskill	Are you hot?
c503_10_skill	Where's the breeze?
c503_10_spa	A heated body\craves cold water.\Even so, hot springs aren't so bad.
c503_10_startbt	I can see the shadow of death.
c503_10_story1	I want a life of freedom.\I don't want to offer prayers for the dead or the living.
c503_10_story2	My name is Bari.\What's yours?
c503_10_story3	You receive life in this world, and no matter how much you writhe in agony,\you rot away without ever seeing the light.\What a miserable, sorrowful fate.
c503_10_true1	Please, place stones in this area.\The more there are, the stronger your energy\and the more harmony you can achieve.
c503_10_true2	I'm looking for a guidepost so the great dragon can ascend to the heavens.\Could you become that guidepost?
c503_10_true3	I'm beside Rinko now,\but who knows how things will turn out later, right?\Heh heh.
c503_10_victory	Let's have fun again sometime.
c503_88_boss_long	I will face you.
c503_88_boss_short	You've come a very long way.
c503_88_bubble_prskill	The River Styx is that way.
c503_88_bubble_skill	I can't just let you go.
c503_88_ctskill	Worry not.
c503_88_death_1	To the land of Hades... I go...
c503_88_death_2	Death is an ephemeral fall...
c503_88_drive	The chance to win is mine.
c503_88_hit_1	Ngh!
c503_88_hit_2	It can't be...
c503_88_hit_3	I was careless.
c503_88_hit_4	W-wait just a moment!
c503_88_hit_5	Muster your resolve.
c503_88_hit_6	Ahh!
c503_88_hit_7	Well...
c503_88_hit_8	*sigh*
c503_88_hit_9	What?
c503_88_prskill	The River Styx is that way.
c503_88_skill	I can't just let you go.
c503_boss_long	How do you do? My name is Bari.
c503_boss_short	Thank you for coming.
c503_ctskill	Worry not.
c503_death_1	To the land of Hades... I go...
c503_death_2	Death is an ephemeral fall...
c503_drive	Can you claim victory from me?
c503_hit_1	Wow!
c503_hit_2	Eeep!
c503_hit_3	*whimper*
c503_prskill	How unsightly.
c503_skill	This is the beginning.
c503_spa	This is a land of rest for body and mind.\It's as if I were in the Celestial Realm's paradise.
c503_startbt	Let me take care of things.
c503_story1	I want a life of freedom.\I don't want to offer prayers for the dead or the living.
c503_story2	My name is Bari.\What's yours?
c503_story3	You receive life in this world, and no matter how much you writhe in agony,\you rot away without ever seeing the light.\What a miserable, sorrowful fate.
c503_true1	You truly are a kind individual.\You've treated even me with such kindness...
c503_true2	You have my deepest thanks.\Having said that, Rinko needs me.
c503_true3	If you manage to become Archfiend,\do please remember my face.
c503_victory	I owe it to you.
c504_boss_long	Let's talk this out, shall we?
c504_boss_short	*sigh* This is what I mean about demons...
c504_ctskill	Please, just stop!
c504_death_1	*sniffle* You best not forget this...
c504_death_2	I can't... believe it!
c504_drive	I'll show you the power of a demon!
c504_hit_1	Agh...
c504_hit_2	You went there, huh?!
c504_hit_3	I gotta get out of here!
c504_prskill	You asked for it.
c504_skill	I hate fighting, but...
c504_spa	Hold on a second!\Have you been hogging this awesome place\this whole time?
c504_startbt	If I win, could you go home?
c504_story1	Huh...\So this is how demons feel\when they create Childs.\It's pretty great! Haha!
c504_story2	Ack... I'm not running away or anything.\I've got a thing... Y-yeah, a previous engagement!\So, see ya!
c504_story3	That's not for you to know.\Oh? What is this drink?\This is not half bad!
c504_true1	Whatever problem you have, you can talk it out.\You couldn't be more wrong\if you think being a demon means I have bloodlust.
c504_true2	I wouldn't mind being the lady of a tiny castle in the Mortal Realm.\Being Archfiend doesn't suit me anyway.
c504_true3	If you become Archfiend,\make it so I can stay in the Mortal Realm.\I like it.\You could do that, right?
c504_victory	Done fighting?
c505_00_boss_long	Looks so lively!
c505_00_boss_short	Ready to go?
c505_00_ctskill	Cheer me on, okay?!
c505_00_death_1	They got me...
c505_00_death_2	I lost but it was fun!
c505_00_drive	All-out sprint!
c505_00_hit_1	Aaah!
c505_00_hit_2	Gyaaah!
c505_00_hit_3	Ahaha, oh dang it.
c505_00_prskill	I'll catch up to you in no time flat!
c505_00_skill	Out of breath already?
c505_00_spa	Nothing beats a nice hot spring after a ton of running!
c505_00_startbt	It's on!
c505_00_story1	I do my best regardless of my opponent.\It's no fun otherwise!
c505_00_story2	You can't win if you run halfheartedly.\You have to run like a wild beast.\Like a, uh, cheetah or something.
c505_00_story3	Okay, whenever you're ready.\Let's have us a fun running this time!
c505_00_true1	It feels incredible to run\pushing past the wind!\You feel like the fastest runner in the world.
c505_00_true2	Sayaka's a total cutie.\I wish everyone would notice that.
c505_00_true3	Running hard is great,\but you gotta rest from time to time, too.\After all, you can usually go even faster\after a good rest!
c505_00_victory	That was a good race.
c505_10_boss_long	Welcome. No cheating, alright?
c505_10_boss_short	Want a match with me?
c505_10_ctskill	You're not going to run, are you?
c505_10_death_1	Oh, no... I lost...
c505_10_death_2	Gah!
c505_10_drive	I'll overtake you at once.
c505_10_hit_1	Wah!
c505_10_hit_2	Ahh!
c505_10_hit_3	Still too far.
c505_10_prskill	Don't fall too far behind.
c505_10_skill	I'm faster than any one of you!
c505_10_spa	Ah! Following up a race with a hot bath...\This is perfect!
c505_10_startbt	Run!
c505_10_story1	You're so enthusiastic. That's the spirit!\Okay, let's climb to the top together!
c505_10_story2	The air feels cool and the sky is blue.\It's a perfect day for a race!
c505_10_story3	Everything's better when we do it together.\Hm, I want to see Notus all of a sudden. I'm going to go race with her.
c505_10_true1	Every day I ran,\hoping I'd find a new master one day.
c505_10_true2	I just ran all day because it's the only\thing I could do and wanted to do.
c505_10_true3	Now, I know what it's like to run together with others.\I really enjoy running with Notus!
c505_10_victory	I never even thought about losing!
c505_boss_long	Want a match with me?
c505_boss_short	Bring it on. Ho ho!
c505_ctskill	You can never catch me.
c505_death_1	I can't believe I lost!
c505_death_2	I'm not going to lose next time!
c505_drive	I'd better be serious this time.
c505_hit_1	Wah!
c505_hit_2	That stings.
c505_hit_3	Ouch!
c505_prskill	Let's go!
c505_skill	Time to blow off some steam!
c505_spa	Ah! Following up a race with a hot bath...\This is perfect!
c505_startbt	Who's the tagger?
c505_story1	You're so enthusiastic. That's the spirit!\Okay, let's climb to the top together!
c505_story2	The air feels cool and the sky is blue.\It's a perfect day for a race!
c505_story3	Everything's better when we do it together.\Hm, I want to see Notus all of a sudden. I'm going to go race with her.
c505_true1	When I was first abandoned, I didn't know what to do.\But now, I'm okay. I've found someone who's much better than my old master.
c505_true2	I love running with Notus.\I could do it all day.
c505_true3	Day or night, rain or shine,\I'm going to run. That's my destiny!
c505_victory	Teehee! Of course, I won.
c506_00_boss_long	Looks like fun.
c506_00_boss_short	Let's get this show on the road, then.
c506_00_ctskill	Get ready to lose!
c506_00_death_1	I can't believe I couldn't catch up...
c506_00_death_2	Guess I gotta... admit defeat...
c506_00_drive	I'm gonna come out on top!
c506_00_hit_1	Agh!
c506_00_hit_2	That was close.
c506_00_hit_3	Oof!
c506_00_prskill	I can't wait.
c506_00_skill	Move it!
c506_00_spa	You're surprisingly nice\taking me to a hot spring like this!\I'll have to brag to Kitasato.
c506_00_startbt	Let's get going.
c506_00_story1	Cycling makes me feel alive.\That's why I can't stop.
c506_00_story2	I get it now. I just kept cycling like a maniac.\I must've forgotten the fundamentals.
c506_00_story3	Cycling on your own is fun,\but when you do it with someone...\It feels like being one with the wind.
c506_00_true1	My dream is to keep hitting the road on my bike\even when I'm a grandma.\Hehe, pretty cool, huh?
c506_00_true2	I learned a new way to enjoy cycling\thanks to Kitasato.\She's a great mentor, for real.
c506_00_true3	I might be able to beat yesterday's time today.\I hope I can become someone who improves every day.
c506_00_victory	That was a blast.
c506_boss_long	Sock it to me!
c506_boss_short	Ready to run with me?
c506_ctskill	I'm hard to overtake.
c506_death_1	Not bad.
c506_death_2	I'll win next time.
c506_drive	Let's run!
c506_hit_1	Urgh!
c506_hit_2	I'm fine.
c506_hit_3	My bad.
c506_prskill	I'll overtake you.
c506_skill	This is going to be fun!
c506_spa	You're such a good master,\bringing me to a hot spring like this.
c506_startbt	Want to see which of us is faster?
c506_story1	Maybe I can meet new Childs. I'm so excited!\I had so much fun when I first met Boreas.
c506_story2	Alright, maybe I should have a race with Boreas.\I have a feeling I'll win this time. Demon, be our referee!
c506_story3	Why don't you want to judge our race for us?\Don't you want to see me win?
c506_true1	I'm glad to have met such a nice master.\You're so nice that sometimes I feel bad for acting a bit spoiled.
c506_true2	I can never get tired of racing with Boreas.\Speaking of which, I'm going to go race with her now.
c506_true3	I like competing,\and I love winning.
c506_victory	Good race.
c507_00_boss_long	What do you say to a drink?
c507_00_boss_short	Did you bring booze?
c507_00_ctskill	Quit complaining!
c507_00_death_1	Ah...
c507_00_death_2	I got ahead of myself...
c507_00_drive	Argh, what a pain.
c507_00_hit_1	Ack!
c507_00_hit_2	Ouch!
c507_00_hit_3	You cheeky little...
c507_00_prskill	I'll put an end to this myself.
c507_00_skill	You better get ready.
c507_00_spa	What's this?\Did you prepare this hot spring just for me?\'Cause you know, I prefer booze.
c507_00_startbt	Demons, I tell ya...
c507_00_story1	Man... All I do is pray, day in and day out.\And don't get me started on the dancing I gotta do at New Year's.
c507_00_story2	Feeling the salty air helped a little.\Hey!\Bring more booze!
c507_00_story3	This might be the first time I get a compliment.\Not a fan.
c507_00_true1	All this talking about the old days. Boring!\If you really want me to listen,\then join me for a drink.
c507_00_true2	Do you think I want to be a shrine maiden?\What I wouldn't give to just drink alcohol and nap every day.
c507_00_true3	Nothing you can do about the fate you were born with.\I'm bound to be a shrine maiden. No two ways about it.
c507_00_victory	I'll play with you again next time!
c507_10_boss_long	Hey, you wanna have some fun?
c507_10_boss_short	C'mere!
c507_10_ctskill	What a pain...
c507_10_death_1	Ugh...
c507_10_death_2	Oh, I don't know!
c507_10_drive	Take it easy.
c507_10_hit_1	Urk...
c507_10_hit_2	Agh!
c507_10_hit_3	Ack!
c507_10_prskill	Hah hah hah!
c507_10_skill	There's nothing to do...
c507_10_spa	What's this?\Did you prepare this hot spring just for me?\'Cause you know, I prefer booze.
c507_10_startbt	Did you grab some snacks?
c507_10_story1	I have an idea!\You should do it!\That way I can drink the gift booze!
c507_10_story2	Was my pactmaker\that great a shaman?\I never knew.
c507_10_story3	The villagers honestly seem to believe\I'm some sort of god or something.\Bah hah hah!
c507_10_true1	Humans are so darn interesting.\I don't think I could tire of observing them.
c507_10_true2	Just because I'm a Child doesn't mean I need to obey a demon, right?\Can't we just get along and call it a day?
c507_10_true3	Why are you so unhappy, Chandra?\You'll exhaust yourself if all you do is complain.
c507_10_victory	Going home already?
c507_88_boss_long	I'll defend the village!
c507_88_boss_short	Hey! What a surprise!
c507_88_bubble_prskill	Hang in there a little longer!
c507_88_bubble_skill	You're not tired already are you?
c507_88_ctskill	I'll save you.
c507_88_death_1	That's mean...
c507_88_death_2	Ugh...
c507_88_drive	Aah... I feel amazing!
c507_88_hit_1	Ahhh!
c507_88_hit_2	Gwah!
c507_88_hit_3	That hurts, you know!
c507_88_hit_4	Watch it.
c507_88_hit_5	Bah...
c507_88_hit_6	Are you done already?
c507_88_hit_7	I said wait!
c507_88_hit_8	Ngh...
c507_88_hit_9	What is it with you?
c507_88_prskill	Hang in there a little longer!
c507_88_skill	You're not tired already are you?
c507_boss_long	Hah hah hah!\I'm this village's shrine maiden!
c507_boss_short	Throw one back?
c507_ctskill	I'll save you.
c507_death_1	That's mean...
c507_death_2	Ugh...
c507_drive	I feel so good!
c507_hit_1	Guh...
c507_hit_2	I'm on your side, you know.
c507_hit_3	Wait! Wait!
c507_prskill	I'll protect the village!
c507_skill	What do you say to a drink?
c507_spa	What's this?\Did you prepare this hot spring just for me?\'Cause you know, I prefer booze.
c507_startbt	Let's get this over with. I've got drinks to drink!
c507_story1	I have an idea!\You should do it!\That way I can drink the gift booze!
c507_story2	Was my pactmaker\that great a shaman?\I never knew.
c507_story3	The villagers honestly seem to believe\I'm some sort of god or something.\Bah hah hah!
c507_true1	What even is a shrine maiden?\Can't I just stay in the shrine and drink?\I'm not here to bandage annoyances.
c507_true2	Do I have to stay cooped up\in the shrine all the time?\*sigh* It's so boring.
c507_true3	Why can't Childs get drunk\on human alcohol?\I wanna try getting drunk like my pactmaker.
c507_victory	No biggie.
c508_boss_long	I sense a demon.
c508_boss_short	I'll fight you.
c508_ctskill	This is the end.
c508_death_1	I couldn't protect the village...
c508_death_2	Oh... God...
c508_drive	I'll tear you to shreds!
c508_hit_1	Ngh!
c508_hit_2	Urg!
c508_hit_3	Hmph. Is that all you've got?
c508_prskill	Leave the village.
c508_skill	There's no use in arguing.
c508_spa	What is this?\I've never seen a place like this.
c508_startbt	Who's there?!
c508_story1	Don't worry about it.\I'll be leaving shortly.
c508_story2	I never thought I'd feel\a smile on my face again.
c508_story3	Have the villagers return to their homes.\It'll be dangerous if the tree falls.
c508_true1	I care not what the villagers think of me.\I don't want anything.
c508_true2	Sulhee probably isn't fit to serve the divine.\I feel sorry for her.
c508_true3	That day I saw my brother's finger move,\but I fled in terror.\The one who really killed my brother was me.
c508_victory	Never trespass upon this place again.
c509_10_boss_long	Am I truly so frightening?
c509_10_boss_short	I see I have some uninvited guests.
c509_10_ctskill	Abandon all hope.
c509_10_death_1	We'll meet again.
c509_10_death_2	Oh, time is so fleeting...
c509_10_drive	I can only hold back so much.
c509_10_hit_1	The pinnacle of idiocy.
c509_10_hit_2	What a weakling.
c509_10_hit_3	All you do will be futile.
c509_10_prskill	Yield.
c509_10_skill	Have you mustered your resolve?
c509_10_spa	Vlad told me a funny story.\Um... It was one where everyone\died at the end.
c509_10_startbt	I won't betray the trust you place in me.
c509_10_story1	Still, your meeting is decidedly\not merely serendipity.
c509_10_story2	But you wouldn't be happy,\even if I defied the laws of Heaven\and saved your life.
c509_10_story3	I can say with certainty\the time you spent with Mona was not wasted.
c509_10_true1	Don't obsess over the memories you lost.\Even if they're gone,\that doesn't mean the past is gone, as well.
c509_10_true2	I finally found you\within the ceaseless flow of time.\Should we part here, I wonder when we might meet again.
c509_10_true3	I was born in Hell,\but for a moment, I tasted Heaven.\How blessed am I?
c509_10_victory	Thank you for believing in me.
c509_88_boss_long	You walk the road to destruction.
c509_88_boss_short	Welcome to my citadel.
c509_88_bubble_prskill	Allow me to bring an end to this fight.
c509_88_bubble_skill	Away with you.
c509_88_ctskill	Can you not admit your loss?
c509_88_death_1	Let me see him...
c509_88_death_2	I let my guard slip.
c509_88_drive	The night is come.
c509_88_hit_1	You're going to regret that.
c509_88_hit_2	Could you clear the way for me?
c509_88_hit_3	I find this discomforting.
c509_88_hit_4	So boisterous.
c509_88_hit_5	Leave.
c509_88_hit_6	Heh...
c509_88_hit_7	*sigh*
c509_88_hit_8	Will you squander this chance?
c509_88_hit_9	Frittering time away.
c509_88_prskill	Allow me to bring an end to this fight.
c509_88_skill	Away with you.
c509_boss_long	If you're going to surrender, you'd best do it now.
c509_boss_short	What a fool you are.
c509_ctskill	Can you not admit your loss?
c509_death_1	Let me see him...
c509_death_2	I let my guard slip.
c509_drive	The night is come.
c509_hit_1	No need for disquiet.
c509_hit_2	Ngh...
c509_hit_3	I feel such disappointment.
c509_prskill	Allow me to lend a hand.
c509_skill	You've no sense of decorum, do you?
c509_spa	Vlad told me a funny story.\Um... It was one where everyone\died at the end.
c509_startbt	I have made my preparations.
c509_story1	Still, your meeting is decidedly\not merely serendipity.
c509_story2	But you wouldn't be happy,\even if I defied the laws of Heaven\and saved your life.
c509_story3	I can say with certainty\the time you spent with Mona was not wasted.
c509_true1	The longer I spend alone\the more my joyous memories fade,\until only the bitterest remain.
c509_true2	You're supposed to be Deucalion?\Why do I fail to see any resemblance?
c509_true3	I tried to change history for Vlad's sake.\But time marches too quickly,\and there is no stopping it.
c509_victory	At long last, I can rest.
c510_10_boss_long	Angels on high, grant me victory!
c510_10_boss_short	Who's batting leadoff?
c510_10_ctskill	If your wounds hurt, just roll over and die.
c510_10_death_1	That was a grueling fight...
c510_10_death_2	I lost this one.
c510_10_drive	Lord, bestow your grace upon us.
c510_10_hit_1	Gah!
c510_10_hit_2	Are you hoping to die?
c510_10_hit_3	What do you want from me?
c510_10_prskill	Let the enemy flee!
c510_10_skill	So this is how it goes.
c510_10_spa	Expecting a gift or something?\Hate to break it to ya, but I'm broke.
c510_10_startbt	I can help you if you want.
c510_10_story1	Why would I be at a bar if I weren't here to drink?
c510_10_story2	I don't care about the rest of the riffraff.\If I can track down the Vampire Queen,\I'm satisfied.
c510_10_story3	Don't push your luck.\You underestimate me at your own peril.
c510_10_true1	Don't complain.\Life is largely trivial.\The only difference is whether you know that or not.
c510_10_true2	I'm more comfortable alone.\When others are around,\I just get annoyed.
c510_10_true3	I enjoy when you're desperately trying to look tough.\It gives me a good laugh.
c510_10_victory	A victory? That's not worth boasting about.
c510_boss_long	Let's take it easy.
c510_boss_short	You've got guts, do ya?
c510_ctskill	So you want me to save you?
c510_death_1	I messed up...
c510_death_2	That was a waste of energy.
c510_drive	O, mighty King!
c510_hit_1	How unpleasant...
c510_hit_2	Oof!
c510_hit_3	Scram.
c510_prskill	O, God of Night.
c510_skill	Don't get too worked up.
c510_spa	Expecting a gift or something?\Hate to break it to ya, but I'm broke.
c510_startbt	Think you can keep up?
c510_story1	Why would I be at a bar if I weren't here to drink?
c510_story2	I don't care about the rest of the riffraff.\If I can track down the Vampire Queen,\I'm satisfied.
c510_story3	Don't push your luck.\You underestimate me at your own peril.
c510_true1	It isn't in my nature to be a hunter.\I'm doing it because I have to.\Believe it or not, I believe in fate.
c510_true2	I thought I could live in peace\if I killed the Vampire Queen.\Hmph. How mistaken I was.
c510_true3	Try not to risk your life.\You're trying to survive, aren't you?
c510_victory	That was a walk in the park.
c511_boss_long	I'm not who I used to be! I'm different!
c511_boss_short	What do I do? They found me!
c511_ctskill	Looks like now's my chance!
c511_death_1	I don't wanna die... Not yet...
c511_death_2	Take care...
c511_drive	I'm here with you!
c511_hit_1	Argh...
c511_hit_2	That hurts.
c511_hit_3	Gah!
c511_prskill	You can't let your guard down!
c511_skill	I'll rescue you!
c511_spa	Did you set this up for me?
c511_startbt	I'm not sure about this...
c511_story1	*sigh* I was so indecisive\that now I've made another person mad.
c511_story2	Turan's saved me more times than I can count.\Now, it's my turn to save her.
c511_story3	What is that? I'm not sure I know.
c511_true1	Why am I such a fool?\I want to be a friend you can trust\like Turan.
c511_true2	Turan will probably have more fun being with someone\who can identify with her feelings.
c511_true3	I'm so unsure and melancholy...\If it wasn't for Turan,\I wouldn't accomplish anything.
c511_victory	What a relief.
c512_boss_long	If it's to meet him...
c512_boss_short	Have you ever fallen in love with someone?
c512_ctskill	The power of love is incredible!
c512_death_1	No...
c512_death_2	I can't die... Not like this.
c512_drive	This is how I feel!
c512_hit_1	Let me go!
c512_hit_2	Eeep!
c512_hit_3	Ahh...
c512_prskill	This isn't over!
c512_skill	I got 'em!
c512_spa	Oh wow, this is such a nice place.\Do humans come here, too?
c512_startbt	I'm so excited!
c512_story1	The way he talks and walks and that marvelous scent that drifts from him...\He's just perfect.
c512_story2	Where could he have gone?\I can't see him anywhere.
c512_story3	I didn't know...\I never knew you were burdened\with these worries and anxiety.
c512_true1	Couldn't we live our lives\on our own without relying on any demons? Couldn't we be free?
c512_true2	I'm okay if we don't meet again.\That's how happy it made me.
c512_true3	Without Philotes, I couldn't have escaped\that demon. I could never find another friend\quite like her.
c512_victory	Yay, I did it!
c513_10_boss_long	Shall I deliver you to paradise?
c513_10_boss_short	Hello, my cute little sheep!
c513_10_ctskill	It wouldn't be any fun if I held back!
c513_10_death_1	Hee hee hee hee hee hee...
c513_10_death_2	See you again...
c513_10_drive	I'll let you have as much fun as you want.
c513_10_hit_1	Oh, you foolish thing.
c513_10_hit_2	Tch...
c513_10_hit_3	That's amazing!
c513_10_prskill	Now, how to punish you?
c513_10_skill	That expression is just irresistible. ♥
c513_10_spa	Look at all these intrusive pests.\I wish it were just you and me.
c513_10_startbt	Oh, I'm having the time of my life.
c513_10_story1	Why did you get rid\of such a useful slave?\What a silly demon you are.
c513_10_story2	Maybe they'd realized\that the god they believe in\isn't the real savior.
c513_10_story3	Mitra told you to do that, did he not?\You wouldn't dare go against\his orders now, would you?
c513_10_true1	I'm gonna make lots and lots of Childs\and give the demons a thorough thrashing.
c513_10_true2	Do you know what the most fun thing in the world is?\It's giving your opponent hope and then toying with them.\Hee hee hee hee hee...
c513_10_true3	Hell would definitely be fun if we were together.\Don't you want to come with me?
c513_10_victory	You have to kneel, you know.
c513_87_boss_long	Do I want to fight? Why, yes. I'd be more than happy to.
c513_87_boss_short	How cute!
c513_87_bubble_prskill	Let's enjoy ourselves more. More!
c513_87_bubble_skill	Don't you go running away, now.
c513_87_ctskill	Run along if you please.
c513_87_death_1	You'll bring god's curse upon you.
c513_87_death_2	There will be a second coming...
c513_87_drive	God's curse be upon you!
c513_87_hit_1	I hate when things hurt...
c513_87_hit_2	You're really trying there, aren't you?
c513_87_hit_3	That's not funny.
c513_87_hit_4	What an eyesore.
c513_87_hit_5	Want to play hide-and-seek?
c513_87_hit_6	Silly goose.
c513_87_hit_7	Hmph!
c513_87_hit_8	Luck is on your side.
c513_87_hit_9	Keep going.
c513_87_prskill	Let's enjoy ourselves more. More!
c513_87_skill	Don't you go running away, now.
c513_88_boss_long	This is the goddess' paradise.
c513_88_boss_short	Welcome, my lost sheep.
c513_88_bubble_prskill	Repent.
c513_88_bubble_skill	Repent.
c513_88_ctskill	Run along if you please.
c513_88_death_1	You'll bring god's curse upon you.
c513_88_death_2	There will be a second coming...
c513_88_drive	Come greet your god!
c513_88_hit_1	Foolish indeed.
c513_88_hit_2	How dare you?
c513_88_hit_3	Please, don't doubt me.
c513_88_hit_4	Do not insult me.
c513_88_hit_5	See the light.
c513_88_hit_6	Atone.
c513_88_hit_7	How arrogant.
c513_88_hit_8	You are ignorant.
c513_88_hit_9	You will be trapped in darkness.
c513_88_prskill	False prophets will be judged.
c513_88_skill	Come greet your god!
c513_89_boss_long	This is the idol's paradise.
c513_89_boss_short	Welcome, my lost sheep.
c513_89_bubble_prskill	Repent.
c513_89_bubble_skill	Repent.
c513_89_ctskill	Run along if you please.
c513_89_death_1	You'll bring god's curse upon you.
c513_89_death_2	There will be a second coming...
c513_89_drive	Come greet your god!
c513_89_hit_1	Foolish indeed.
c513_89_hit_2	How dare you?
c513_89_hit_3	Please, don't doubt me.
c513_89_hit_4	Do not insult me.
c513_89_hit_5	See the light.
c513_89_hit_6	Atone.
c513_89_hit_7	How arrogant.
c513_89_hit_8	You are ignorant.
c513_89_hit_9	You will be trapped in darkness.
c513_89_prskill	False prophets will be judged.
c513_89_skill	Come greet your god!
c513_boss_long	This is the idol's paradise.
c513_boss_short	Welcome, my lost sheep.
c513_ctskill	Run along if you please.
c513_death_1	You'll bring god's curse upon you.
c513_death_2	There will be a second coming...
c513_drive	Come greet your god!
c513_hit_1	Foolish indeed.
c513_hit_2	How dare you?
c513_hit_3	Please, don't doubt me.
c513_prskill	False prophets will be judged.
c513_skill	Repent.
c513_spa	If you offer this place up unto me,\I shall give you a reward.
c513_startbt	Have you prepared the sacrifice?
c513_story1	Why did you get rid\of such a useful slave?\What a silly demon you are.
c513_story2	I am Akrasia,\the shepherd who will guide you simpletons to the light.
c513_story3	Mitra told you to do that, did he not?\You wouldn't dare go against\his orders now, would you?
c513_true1	My armies will overrun the Mortal Realm,\and yes, even Hell.
c513_true2	I am the one, all-guiding light.\Now, heed my voice.
c513_true3	Do you want to go to heaven?\The place you are allowed to go\is the endlessly burning lake of fire in Hell.
c513_victory	Glorify.
c514_boss_long	Let's get it over with.
c514_boss_short	Who are you?
c514_ctskill	Argh! This is so obnoxious!
c514_death_1	I've had it, for real!
c514_death_2	You just got lucky!
c514_drive	Let's see... Am I gonna let you live or kill you?
c514_hit_1	You're in the way!
c514_hit_2	You wanna die?
c514_hit_3	Cut it out.
c514_prskill	Can I get a "help me, please"?
c514_skill	Not even worth fighting it out.
c514_spa	I didn't know there was an Infernal Realm Spa in the Mortal Realm!\That gets rid of any reason to go back to the Infernal Realm, doesn't it?
c514_startbt	I could help you out, you know?
c514_story1	Hurry up and say your wish!\Geez, you get on my nerves!\Out with it or I'll kill you.
c514_story2	What's the hold up? Lead the way already.\We need to give those bullies of yours what's comin' to them.
c514_story3	Right?\There's no point in praise or ministry.\Only one thing's memorable and that's money.
c514_true1	Humans have no power and they're still so greedy.\Maybe that's why they tell demons their wishes.
c514_true2	Why do you act all high and mighty?\Only thing you've got goin' for you is that face anyway... Hmph...
c514_true3	When I build a kingdom, I'll give you a job in it.\Like... How about Lady Duetsha's jester?\Bahaha!
c514_victory	Pay me some more respect!
c517_boss_long	This looks like a fun toy.
c517_boss_short	I'm getting my hopes up.
c517_ctskill	Aim! Fire!
c517_death_1	You know, I'm this close to going off!
c517_death_2	This is whack!
c517_drive	Out of breath already?
c517_hit_1	Huh?
c517_hit_2	That's wild!
c517_hit_3	Hit the ground!
c517_prskill	Drop dead!
c517_skill	Bang!
c517_spa	You want to hop in with me?\Aw heck, why not? But only 'cause you're the Master.
c517_startbt	Who do I bully first?
c517_story1	Childs are great, aren't they? They're hilarious!
c517_story2	Someone calling me?
c517_story3	Should we begin, then?\Let's get Master's surprise party started!
c517_true1	Boring! Got anything fun to do?\If you don't hang out with me\I'll bully you to death!
c517_true2	Don't run off!\I'm saying I'll hang out with you!
c517_true3	No sense running away, Master!\I'll follow you to the ends of the earth! Gahaha!\Wait, I may've actually scared him off.
c517_victory	What? It's over already?
c520_10_boss_long	Everyone in the Infernal and Mortal Realm, get lost!
c520_10_boss_short	You're one of them, aren't you, Sarasu?
c520_10_ctskill	Drop dead!
c520_10_death_1	Urg!
c520_10_death_2	Pandora...
c520_10_drive	Destiny can get wrecked.
c520_10_hit_1	Ack!
c520_10_hit_2	Hngh!
c520_10_hit_3	You dare...
c520_10_prskill	Destiny, shmestiny!
c520_10_skill	A real eyesore.
c520_10_spa	This is so wonderful I could forget all my cares.
c520_10_startbt	Tricks of fate? I'm gonna smash 'em.
c520_10_story1	That means there's a mere 2 left, huh?
c520_10_story2	Sarasu!\Wait up!\This is no way to say goodbye!
c520_10_story3	Here's hoping I can destroy the trap of fate\set by you-know-who.
c520_10_true1	Did I spend thousands--tens of thousands--of years\to get... this?
c520_10_true2	Sarasu must have been tricked.\If not, I'm in trouble.
c520_10_true3	I'll try waiting a little longer.\I'm definitely getting closer.
c520_10_victory	Destiny may try to stop me, but I'm not scared!
c520_87_boss_long	Everyone in the Infernal and Mortal Realm, get lost!
c520_87_boss_short	You're one of them, aren't you, Sarasu?
c520_87_bubble_prskill	Ready to accept your fate?
c520_87_bubble_skill	If it hurts, then scream!\It's more fun that way.
c520_87_ctskill	Outta my sight!
c520_87_death_1	Ngh...
c520_87_death_2	Pandora...
c520_87_drive	Don't lie to me.

c520_87_hit_3	You dare...
c520_87_hit_4	Gutsy.
c520_87_hit_5	Well, that won't do.
c520_87_hit_6	Get lost already.
c520_87_hit_7	Huh. Pain...
c520_87_hit_8	Tch!

c520_boss_short	I don't believe in destiny.
c520_ctskill	Outta my sight!
c520_death_1	Ngh...
c520_death_2	Pandora...
c520_drive	Don't lie to me.
c520_hit_1	Ngh...
c520_hit_2	Argh...
c520_hit_3	You dare...
c520_prskill	It's too soon to relax!
c520_skill	Does it hurt?
c520_spa	This is so wonderful I could forget all my cares.
c520_startbt	I will bring you back to life, Pandora.
c520_story1	That means there's a mere 2 left, huh?
c520_story2	Sarasu!\Wait up!\This is no way to say goodbye!
c520_story3	Here's hoping I can destroy the trap of fate\set by you-know-who.
c520_true1	I finally found a clue.
c520_true2	To think the legend of the Hades Flower was spreading through the Mortal Realm.
c520_true3	Destiny's more powerful than I thought.
c520_victory	I told you not to lie, didn't I?
c521_10_boss_long	Don't group me with that lot.
c521_10_boss_short	Get out of my way.
c521_10_ctskill	You don't know when to stop.
c521_10_death_1	I won't let you get your way.
c521_10_death_2	I won't be forgetting this.
c521_10_drive	Let me do what I want.
c521_10_hit_1	Hmph.
c521_10_hit_2	Don't you touch me!
c521_10_hit_3	What an idiot.
c521_10_prskill	Can you get out of the way?
c521_10_skill	Shut up.
c521_10_spa	This isn't my style.
c521_10_startbt	I'll do exactly as I am told.
c521_10_story1	I can't say I was born\from the wish to be like that idiot.
c521_10_story2	No need for that.\I have zero qualms about leaving you\the moment I get the chance.
c521_10_story3	Maybe becoming your master's Child was a good thing.
c521_10_true1	Looks like I made Dalia pretty mad.\Oh, well, what can you do?\She brought it upon herself.
c521_10_true2	I'm not about to blame Dalia\for not being respectable.\Isn't that how all demons are?
c521_10_true3	Don't think you own me now,\just because I'll fight for you.
c521_10_victory	Lucky me.
c521_87_boss_long	I won't let you have your way, you know.
c521_87_boss_short	You must be pretty lucky to get this far.
c521_87_bubble_prskill	Are you trying to annoy me?
c521_87_bubble_skill	Go where I can't see you.
c521_87_ctskill	Do not underestimate me.
c521_87_death_1	You'll be sorry you did that!
c521_87_death_2	How...
c521_87_drive	Mind if I test out my strength?
c521_87_hit_1	Oh, please.
c521_87_hit_2	Don't mind me.
c521_87_hit_3	Tch.
c521_87_hit_4	Ngh!
c521_87_hit_5	You've got no chance of winning.
c521_87_hit_6	What a pain.
c521_87_hit_7	What the...
c521_87_hit_8	You're way too excited.
c521_87_hit_9	If that's it, I'm good.
c521_87_prskill	Are you trying to annoy me?
c521_87_skill	Go where I can't see you.
c521_88_boss_long	I won't let you have your way, you know.

c521_88_death_2	How...
c521_88_drive	Mind if I test out my strength?
c521_88_hit_1	Oh, please.
c521_88_hit_2	Don't mind me.
c521_88_hit_3	Tch.
c521_88_hit_4	Ngh!
c521_88_hit_5	You've got no chance of winning.
c521_88_hit_6	What a pain.
c521_88_hit_7	What the...
c521_88_hit_8	You're way too excited.
c521_88_hit_9	If that's it, I'm good.
c521_88_prskill	Are you trying to annoy me?
c521_88_skill	Go where I can't see you.
c521_89_boss_long	I won't let you have your way, you know.
c521_89_boss_short	You must be pretty lucky to get this far.
c521_89_bubble_prskill	Are you trying to annoy me?
c521_89_bubble_skill	Go where I can't see you.
c521_89_ctskill	Do not underestimate me.
c521_89_death_1	You'll be sorry you did that!
c521_89_death_2	How...
c521_89_drive	Mind if I test out my strength?
c521_89_hit_1	Oh, please.
c521_89_hit_2	Don't mind me.
c521_89_hit_3	Tch.
c521_89_hit_4	Ngh!
c521_89_hit_5	You've got no chance of winning.
c521_89_hit_6	What a pain.
c521_89_hit_7	What the...
c521_89_hit_8	You're way too excited.
c521_89_hit_9	If that's it, I'm good.
c521_89_prskill	Are you trying to annoy me?
c521_89_skill	Go where I can't see you.
c521_boss_long	What an unpleasant encounter.
c521_boss_short	This won't be as easy as you think.
c521_ctskill	Do not underestimate me.
c521_death_1	You'll be sorry you did that!
c521_death_2	How...
c521_drive	Mind if I test out my strength?
c521_hit_1	Urgh!
c521_hit_2	You're gonna wish you hadn't done that.
c521_hit_3	Expect payback.
c521_prskill	There's no way I'm going down.
c521_skill	Now that's pathetic.
c521_spa	This isn't my style.
c521_startbt	Should I wipe them out?
c521_story1	I can't say I was born\from the wish to be like that idiot.
c521_story2	No need for that.\I have zero qualms about leaving you\the moment I get the chance.
c521_story3	Maybe becoming your master's Child was a good thing.
c521_true1	I thought you wouldn't bug me like Dalia,\but you sure have a way\of pressing my buttons.
c521_true2	I don't want to talk about Dalia.\I'm getting frustrated just thinking about her.
c521_true3	I don't belong to any demon.\I could leave you at any time\if I felt like it.
c521_victory	Are you happy now?
c522_boss_long	I will tell you your destinies!
c522_boss_short	That's interesting.
c522_ctskill	Poor, unlucky you.
c522_death_1	Ngh... You cheeky...
c522_death_2	You'd best be ready!
c522_drive	As if I could possibly lose.
c522_hit_1	Whaaat?
c522_hit_2	All talk.
c522_hit_3	That's it?
c522_prskill	Nothing to call home about.
c522_skill	Is it my time to shine?
c522_spa	I followed you here on the assumption\that I was deceived.\So, let's see how "amazing" of a place this actually is.
c522_startbt	You should just do as I say!
c522_story1	You may not understand this right now,\but you're destined to be the most powerful Child in the Infernal Realm.
c522_story2	Don't act like you have it all figured out.\Zegati's my first Child.\She is the destiny I chose.
c522_story3	Everything I'm saying, I say for your sake.\Don't you understand?!
c522_true1	When I'm Archfiend, I'll build a monument with all my achievements\on the highest point of the Infernal Realm.\I'll have to build a statue of myself, too.
c522_true2	Good masters beget good Childs.\Zegati is proof of that.
c522_true3	It's my destiny to be Archfiend.\It was decided the moment I was born.\Who decided it? Why, me, of course!
c522_victory	I told you to trust me, did I not?
c523_88_boss_long	Those who have been naughty will get the stick!
c523_88_boss_short	You meet Santa. You're lucky.
c523_88_bubble_prskill	Now, let me return the favor.
c523_88_bubble_skill	You better not cry!
c523_88_ctskill	Are you tired already?
c523_88_death_1	Cut me some slack...
c523_88_death_2	Ngh...
c523_88_drive	What do you want for Christmas?
c523_88_hit_1	Here you go again.
c523_88_hit_2	You're so greedy.
c523_88_hit_3	Not bad.
c523_88_hit_4	Go away, will you?
c523_88_hit_5	You got lucky!
c523_88_hit_6	Bored?
c523_88_hit_7	Urgh!
c523_88_hit_8	That's it?
c523_88_hit_9	Try harder.
c523_88_prskill	Now, let me return the favor.
c523_88_skill	You better not cry!
c523_boss_long	Shh. Be quiet, will you?
c523_boss_short	Happy to see me?
c523_ctskill	Are you tired already?
c523_death_1	Cut me some slack...
c523_death_2	Ngh...
c523_drive	What do you want for Christmas?
c523_hit_1	That didn't even tickle.
c523_hit_2	How cute!
c523_hit_3	Can't you do better?
c523_prskill	This is only the beginning.
c523_skill	Want to play hide-and-seek?
c523_spa	My skin feels so soft.\This hot spring in the Infernal Realm isn't too bad.
c523_startbt	Merry Christmas!
c523_story1	This doesn't make sense. I thought playing games would make me feel better.\Why am I angrier...?
c523_story2	Hah, hah. He always does things that I tell him not to.
c523_story3	That's not how you ask someone for help.
c523_true1	I did come to find the Christmas Box, but...\I've got nothing but time.
c523_true2	Pepita acts as if she's better than I am,\and yet she can't do anything right.
c523_true3	Christmas is not their birthday.\Why is everyone so antsy to do something on that day?
c523_victory	That was fun!
c524_boss_long	You can't go so easily!
c524_boss_short	I can't say I'm happy to see you.
c524_ctskill	I'll make you pay for your sins.
c524_death_1	Dear Lord, please save me...
c524_death_2	Strategic retreat... Urgh...
c524_drive	I'll punish His enemies!
c524_hit_1	I'll make you pay for this.
c524_hit_2	Ugh!
c524_hit_3	Drat.
c524_prskill	How dare you?
c524_skill	Begone!
c524_spa	Where's Nicole?\There's no way she'd miss out on such a great opportunity.
c524_startbt	It's time for judgment!
c524_story1	But I couldn't be like Nicole.\She's the reincarnation of Santa Claus.
c524_story2	If you want to destroy Christmas,\you'll have to kill me first.
c524_story3	I'd better be prepared more thoroughly.\Alright, time to reevaluate my plans.
c524_true1	I'm not afraid of demons.\I'm just not used to fighting them.
c524_true2	There's no place for demons in this world.\I'll make sure of that.
c524_true3	I swear on Santa Claus's honor that I'll retrieve the Christmas Box.\It's my only goal.
c524_victory	That was tough.
c525_boss_long	I'm O Holy Nightmare!
c525_boss_short	Grilla has come!
c525_ctskill	Fear me!
c525_death_1	I-I'm Grilla—ugh!
c525_death_2	S-sorry...
c525_drive	I'll show you a miracle.
c525_hit_1	Laughable!
c525_hit_2	W-wah!
c525_hit_3	G-go away!
c525_prskill	Begone!
c525_skill	Hmpf!
c525_spa	A-an open-air hot bath in the middle of winter...\I-I'm glad I've joined the Contest.
c525_startbt	Bring it on!
c525_story1	I don't want to be a nightmare...\Not at least to you.
c525_story2	...I-I must brace myself. Yes. I-I'm just\not ready for this whole shebang. I-I've never done this before...
c525_story3	O-O Holy Nightmare...\C-can I become such a great d-demon?
c525_true1	N-no one l-likes me at all.
c525_true2	I-I'll make sure everyone knows my name.\Then... I-I won't be lonely anymore, will I?
c525_true3	I-I'm going to find my partner i-in my own way...\A-a friend who gets me...
c525_victory	Whew... Th-that was scary...
c526_87_boss_long	Show proper respect!
c526_87_boss_short	Don't you know who I am?!
c526_87_bubble_prskill	You don't really think you can win, do you?
c526_87_bubble_skill	Just so you know, I'm really, really strong!
c526_87_ctskill	How's that? Hurts, doesn't it?
c526_87_death_1	My family won't stand for this!

c526_ctskill	How's that? Hurts, doesn't it?
c526_death_1	My family won't stand for this!
c526_death_2	I'm telling Daddy!
c526_drive	Let me give you a taste of my true power.
c526_hit_1	Quit it!
c526_hit_2	Aaah!
c526_hit_3	That hurt...
c526_prskill	This is the strength of my family!
c526_skill	Lost the nerve to even pick a fight?
c526_spa	It looks super hot...\You go in first.\What? You wanna go in together?\Hrmmm... I don't do well with heat.
c526_startbt	Just trust me. Come on!
c526_story1	I'd never seen such a beautiful sight.\I'm used to gloomy skies all day every day.
c526_story2	Did I hit the bull's eye or what?\Gosh, my charm's on point right now!\Heh heh.
c526_story3	Why isn't anyone coming?!\This is just ice water now!\Hello! Can you hear me?!
c526_true1	All of my Childs take one look\at my family's crest\and they're shaking in their boots.\All but Reynard...
c526_true2	I will definitely become Archfiend\and spread word of my family throughout the whole world.\There won't be anyone left who doesn't fear me!
c526_true3	What's wrong with liking cute,\shiny things?\It's demon nature to see something pretty\and just have to have it!
c526_victory	Heh heh, of course I won!
c527_boss_long	I'll play with you.
c527_boss_short	Am I all that beautiful?
c527_ctskill	It doesn't hurt.
c527_death_1	Ngh...
c527_death_2	This wasn't supposed to happen...
c527_drive	You want pets?
c527_hit_1	Agh!
c527_hit_2	Heehee...
c527_hit_3	You're not half bad.
c527_prskill	Teeheehee, that's cute.
c527_skill	Give me a moment...
c527_spa	I had no idea there was such a nice place out there.\Wanna take a dip with me?
c527_startbt	What's this? Are you angry, by chance?
c527_story1	Teeheehee. ♥\This place is just packed with somber, lonely souls.\If I'm going to have some fun, you know it has to be in a place like this.
c527_story2	There's no gate there...\but I will open up my heart...\for someone as great as you...
c527_story3	Teeheehee...\It's an honor to serve you and your friends, Mr. Demon.
c527_true1	My master?\Oh, it's fine. That tiny, little demon...\Heehee, don't mind her.
c527_true2	I want all of your attention\when we're together.\I'm not your average Child. ♥
c527_true3	You're going to be Archfiend?\I don't know, sounds kind of dangerous.\Why don't you leave stuff like that to other demons\and play with me instead?
c527_victory	Can I get a celebratory hug?
c529_boss_long	It's pretty unfortunate that you have to fight me.
c529_boss_short	You'd better not cry while fighting.
c529_ctskill	You didn't know, did you?
c529_death_1	Oops, I did it again...
c529_death_2	Not in my next life... Not again...
c529_drive	Eat this!
c529_hit_1	Urgh!
c529_hit_2	Ow...
c529_hit_3	Enough!
c529_prskill	This is going to be electrifying!
c529_skill	Don't run away!
c529_spa	Wow, it's so nice here! I feel like I'm flying!\I can't believe you didn't bring me here sooner.
c529_startbt	Let's get this over with. I have research to do.
c529_story1	Hmm... Maybe I should join Ashram, too.
c529_story2	Then, I'll be the vice principal and do what you need me to do in that role.
c529_story3	I can't tell you the details, but I think the one destined for me is in Japan.
c529_true1	Hathor, you're like a kid left unattended at the edge of the water.
c529_true2	Ragaraja... She's calmer than I thought she'd be. She's got leadership, too. I imagined she'd be more like Hathor.
c529_true3	Maybe I'll stay here with Hathor for the rest of my life. Still, my calling is more important.
c529_victory	The day's mission is accomplished! Time to get back to my research.
c530_boss_long	What do you want from me?
c530_boss_short	Do you want to know the truth within?
c530_ctskill	You don't mind if it hurts a little, do you?
c530_death_1	To think I would lose...
c530_death_2	Next time... surely, I...
c530_drive	I'll show you the power of the sea!
c530_hit_1	Ow--!
c530_hit_2	That doesn't so much as itch.
c530_hit_3	Refreshing.
c530_prskill	Want to experience something special?
c530_skill	I'll go easy on you.
c530_spa	Ahh... It's so warm...\You know, there are hot springs like these in the ocean, too.\Want to go there with me?
c530_startbt	Let's do this quick so we can go get some food.
c530_story1	My special talent is removing the obstructions in your mind\and unraveling the tangles in your heart.
c530_story2	Distress directly following reincarnation...\I can think of a couple causes.
c530_story3	That's rather serious.\It's almost a miracle you're alive.
c530_true1	You're quite the bigwig.\We're about the same...\No, it seems you're an even more senior exorcist.
c530_true2	How terribly intimidating...\I'd never seen a demigod with such strong magic power.
c530_true3	Calming this raging energy...\will likely take everything I have.
c530_victory	Anything in particular you want to eat?
c537_boss_long	Are you here to capture me, too?
c537_boss_short	I got away... or not!
c537_ctskill	The Captain is shoving off!
c537_death_1	*sniffle* How could you...?
c537_death_2	Which way is paradise?
c537_drive	I told you not to tie me up!
c537_hit_1	Eeek!
c537_hit_2	Huh?
c537_hit_3	Eeep!
c537_prskill	Out of my way.
c537_skill	Oops, sorry!
c537_spa	As far as paradises go, this one's not bad.\Aaah, that feels good... ♪
c537_startbt	Captain Elysion, set sail!
c537_story1	Captain Elysion, sailing away toward freedom!
c537_story2	I don't remember ever canceling\my pact with Master!
c537_story3	*sniffle*\One day I'll go on a journey to find freedom!
c537_true1	You're headed to paradise, aren't you, demon?
c537_true2	Where am I?\Who are these demons?\Why is finding paradise so hard?!
c537_true3	I'm going to set sail\and find a paradise all my own one day.\And I'll live however I please!
c537_victory	Yo-ho, yo-ho ♪\I wonder if I've gotten any closer to paradise.
c538_boss_long	I know what I must do.
c538_boss_short	I will spare no efforts.
c538_ctskill	Please, open your eyes!
c538_death_1	Is this a nightmare?
c538_death_2	Was I of any help?
c538_drive	Behold, the consequences of relying on dreams!
c538_hit_1	Ah...
c538_hit_2	I was careless.
c538_hit_3	Worry not.
c538_prskill	Transmitting signal.
c538_skill	Let me give you a piece of advice.
c538_spa	You're a rather curious person\to bring a mere servant such as myself\to a place like this.
c538_startbt	I am Sallos, your eternal servant.
c538_story1	Am I so much to your liking?
c538_story2	With your permission,\I am able to rewind time at my discretion,\though only in the case of an emergency.
c538_story3	Please, hold me.
c538_true1	Could I have my reunion?\I wonder what you look like now.
c538_true2	If I am able to rewind time,\then I'm ready.
c538_true3	How often it ends this way...\When will my desires be satisfied?\It is with this master as it was with the one before...\*sigh*
c538_victory	Victory belongs to you.
c539_10_boss_long	You should feel honored to face me.
c539_10_boss_short	Tremble in fear.
c539_10_ctskill	This will hurt.
c539_10_death_1	I'm going back to the Infernal Realm...
c539_10_death_2	I can't believe this...
c539_10_drive	I cannot fail twice.
c539_10_hit_1	Hmpf!
c539_10_hit_2	What was that?
c539_10_hit_3	Begone.
c539_10_prskill	This'll be unbearable.
c539_10_skill	Try to stop me.
c539_10_spa	This is too good to enjoy by myself. You should get in.
c539_10_startbt	I am Belial, Executioner of the Infernal Realm.
c539_10_story1	I know you lost your memories of the past, but do you really not remember me?
c539_10_story2	What do you mean? You lived with a number of women until recently.
c539_10_story3	Being in the Mortal Realm for the first time in half a millennium has made me rusty. I can't believe how easily I fell into a trap.
c539_10_true1	I thought we were closer than this...
c539_10_true2	You may have lost your memories and abilities, but you're still a flirt.
c539_10_true3	I'd be in trouble if it weren't for the Chrono Hoplon. What a spunky exorcist!
c539_10_victory	I didn't even know we'd started fighting.
c539_87_boss_long	Not everyone gets to meet the Infernal Realm's consuls.
c539_87_boss_short	Let's do this.
c539_87_bubble_prskill	Brace yourself.
c539_87_bubble_skill	See if you can handle this.
c539_87_ctskill	This will hurt.
c539_87_death_1	Chrono Hoplon... Let's go back...
c539_87_death_2	I need rest.
c539_87_drive	I will end you!
c539_87_hit_1	Hmpf!
c539_87_hit_2	Ow. Hey!
c539_87_hit_3	That tickles.
c539_87_hit_4	Ho ho.
c539_87_hit_5	Ah!
c539_87_hit_6	Did you just hit me?
c539_87_hit_7	Cute.
c539_87_hit_8	Sing for me.
c539_87_hit_9	That stings.
c539_87_prskill	This'll be unbearable.
c539_87_skill	Take this.
c539_88_boss_long	Consider my presence an honor.
c539_88_boss_short	Here I am.
c539_88_bubble_prskill	Take a deep breath and clench your teeth.
c539_88_bubble_skill	Let's warm up, shall we?
c539_88_ctskill	This'll hurt a little.
c539_88_death_1	See you next time.
c539_88_death_2	Once again...
c539_88_drive	Time to end this!
c539_88_hit_1	Hmpf!
c539_88_hit_2	Ow. Hey!
c539_88_hit_3	That tickles.
c539_88_hit_4	Ho ho.
c539_88_hit_5	Ah!
c539_88_hit_6	Did you just hit me?
c539_88_hit_7	Cute.
c539_88_hit_8	Sing for me.
c539_88_hit_9	That stings.
c539_88_prskill	Endure this.
c539_88_skill	Take this.
c539_89_boss_long	Consider my presence an honor.
c539_89_boss_short	Here I am.
c539_89_bubble_prskill	Take a deep breath and clench your teeth.
c539_89_bubble_skill	Let's warm up, shall we?
c539_89_ctskill	This'll hurt a little.
c539_89_death_1	See you next time.
c539_89_death_2	Once again...
c539_89_drive	Time to end this!
c539_89_hit_1	Hmpf!
c539_89_hit_2	Ow. Hey!
c539_89_hit_3	That tickles.
c539_89_hit_4	Ho ho.
c539_89_hit_5	Ah!
c539_89_hit_6	Did you just hit me?
c539_89_hit_7	Cute.
c539_89_hit_8	Sing for me.
c539_89_hit_9	That stings.
c539_89_prskill	Endure this.
c539_89_skill	Take this.
c539_boss_long	Consider my presence an honor.
c539_boss_short	I have come.
c539_ctskill	This'll hurt.
c539_death_1	Ack...
c539_death_2	You're stronger than I thought...
c539_drive	I'm not letting you get away this time!
c539_hit_1	Hmpf!
c539_hit_2	What a joke.
c539_hit_3	That tickles.
c539_prskill	Can you stand this?
c539_skill	Take this.
c539_spa	Hmpf, I'm busy.\Of course, I can't be in a place like this.
c539_startbt	Are you ready to go to hell?
c539_story1	I should go to the Mortal Realm myself. It's not like there are many investigators more capable than Ode, anyway.
c539_story2	It's fun to go from being the temptress to being seduced. I'm still in service myself.
c539_story3	Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Belial, Executioner of the Infernal Realm. It's so good to see you again.
c539_true1	An avatar of "Prometheus" is controlling the Archfiend Contest from behind the scenes? I can't believe it...
c539_true2	Mortals count their age in numbers. How cute!
c539_true3	Is Mitra an avatar of "Prometh"? Is he a reincarnation? Or...?
c539_victory	That was boring.
c545_boss_long	Don't stare at me like that. I'm just worried!
c545_boss_short	I'll go easy on you. Just don't put up too much of a fight.
c545_ctskill	It won't kill you, right?
c545_death_1	...That's it for today.
c545_death_2	I need to rest...
c545_drive	Angel Ariel, maximum power.
c545_hit_1	Gah...
c545_hit_2	Gosh, seriously!
c545_hit_3	That hurts!
c545_prskill	I can't let you slide.
c545_skill	I'll play with you.
c545_spa	Oh my, are you trying to peep? I don't really mind, but... I might get hyped up.
c545_startbt	Let's get this over with. And make it quick.
c545_story1	If you'll let me put it out on television, I might work for you free of charge~☆
c545_story2	I think... I want to know more about that Demon.
c545_story3	I'm on a mission of finding out if the abnormalities in Mortal Realm are part of an Omen.
c545_true1	This is exclusive. It might be my ticket to the promotion I've wanted. Then I'll have easier access to more information.
c545_true2	I don't think this is about trying to become Archfiend. If only I could find out about that Demon... I'll be appreciated in Heaven.
c545_true3	This is so bothersome. Nothing ever happened before. So why is it happening now?
c545_victory	Can you see how our ranks are different?
c550_boss_long	Deck the halls with a grand finale!
c550_boss_short	What?!\You're here to see me?
c550_ctskill	Blessings!
c550_death_1	Christmas Child out...
c550_death_2	The party's over...
c550_drive	Merry Christmas!
c550_hit_1	Ouch!
c550_hit_2	*sniffle*\That's mean...
c550_hit_3	Ouch ouch ouch...
c550_prskill	I'll pray for your victory.
c550_skill	Let's enjoy ourselves.
c550_spa	This hot spring's a little drab, don't you think?\Why don't we put up some Christmas decorations?
c550_startbt	The Christmas Child is here!
c550_story1	Because I'm worried about Carol, of course!
c550_story2	Today, tomorrow, and the day after that!\Wouldn't it be great if it were Christmas every day?
c550_story3	I wanna give Carol the best present ever!
c550_true1	I was thinking Carol might once again\say something she regrets\since she tends to hide her true feelings.
c550_true2	It would be non-stop fun\if every day were Christmas, don't you agree?\Hehe, this'll be great!
c550_true3	Birthdays are days where you\absolutely have to be happy!
c550_victory	I won't fail during Christmas.
c552_boss_long	If we can't avoid it, maybe we should try to enjoy it.
c552_boss_short	The outcome of the match is already decided.
c552_ctskill	Was I faster?
c552_death_1	You mean... I lost?
c552_death_2	I missed my chance...
c552_drive	Let's settle this in a single round.
c552_hit_1	Hmm?
c552_hit_2	What's your deal?!
c552_hit_3	Oof!
c552_prskill	I can't take it anymore.
c552_skill	It won't be that easy.
c552_spa	I have a hard time staying still.
c552_startbt	Do you want to be as lucky as I am?
c552_story1	Who cares about luck?\My goal is to draw the best prize!
c552_story2	I feel like I've seized\a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
c552_story3	I'd hate to waste this chance.\I need to enjoy it to the max!
c552_true1	I can feel first prize.\For real this time!
c552_true2	In life, chance is everything.\If you let it pass you by, that's it.
c552_true3	The clothes have nothing to do with it.\If I'm having fun, isn't that enough?
c552_victory	I mean, this was the obvious outcome.
m003_boss_long	Try this cursed hellfire on for size.
m003_boss_short	This is it!
m003_ctskill	Screaming Flame!
m003_death_1	The spark of anger will never die...

m003_story2	I'll swallow you up and chew you to bits!
m003_story3	I'm always watching you, demon!
m003_true1	Revenge! Revenge! Revenge on the demon who tortures my pactmaker!
m003_true2	We're family, my beloved Squeaky...\I swear I'll always protect you...
m003_true3	Demon... You may have tortured Squeaky, but I won't kill you.\After all, if you die, I could never see him again...

m007_boss_long	Pleasant dreams.
m007_boss_short	Oh boy! A new toy!
m007_ctskill	Which finger do you think this is?
m007_death_1	I'll torment you for life!
m007_death_2	Gwaaah!

m007_spa	Come on in, Demon! It's not hot all. Hahaha.
m007_startbt	Let's play!
m007_story1	Buh-bye! Ahahaha!
m007_story2	I can't tell what humans are thinking at all.
m007_story3	By the way, Demon. Is it really so serious if kids have a nightmare or two?\I thought you demons liked seeing humans suffer.
m007_true1	Demon! Are you gonna play with me this time?\If you don't...I'm gonna tickle you forever! Hahaha!
m007_true2	Heehee! What sort of trick should I play next?\I'm excited just thinking about it!
m007_true3	I'm tired of the Mortal Realm! I think I wanna play in the Infernal Realm next.\Demon! Hurry up and become Archfiend so we can play there!
m007_victory	Is it already over? Now I'm bored again...
m036_boss_long	How unfortunate that we ran into each other. For you, that is...
m036_boss_short	Eespo.
m036_ctskill	Hityatsbu.
m036_death_1	Impressive... Haha...
m036_death_2	Aaah!
m036_drive	Titbyu bi opel.
m036_hit_1	Ugh...
m036_hit_2	Argh!
m036_hit_3	Gaaah!
m036_prskill	Qoli tashamayha?
m036_skill	Hehehe...
m036_spa	Here we are at a hot spring, and you don't even plan to peep? You're so boring...
m036_startbt	Hold your breath and listen up...
m036_story1	I saw.\You are always giving me...\such interesting things to watch.
m036_story2	My talent is to offer whispers in the dark...\Perhaps that human found wisdom in a voice.
m036_story3	You're such a nice demon, Master...\If nobody else is going to make things happen around here, then, well... Hehe...
m036_true1	I want to rip off that mask...\and see what your true face looks like...
m036_true2	Don't trust in yourself too much. Otherwise...\You'll despair at seeing the darkness that lies beneath...
m036_true3	I know there's an evil demon lurking inside you somewhere...\Don't try to hide your true nature from me...
m036_victory	I won... Hehe...
m037_boss_long	You're so lucky you met me.

m037_story1	Humans are so weak.\That's what makes them so much fun to tease!\Kee-kee-kee!
m037_story2	What can I say? My pactmaker likes big events...\Kee-kee-kee... I'd steel myself if I were you...
m037_story3	Kee-kee-kee, I'm not telling you.\The whole point of pranks is that they're secret...until they're not.
m037_true1	Now, what sort of trick should I play next?\Kee-kee-kee, this is going to be fun!
m037_true2	Kee-kee-kee... A demon who behaves like a human?\Ridiculous.
m037_true3	Kee-kee-kee... I can't wait for you to become Archfiend.\By the way...are you sure you don't want to give up?
m037_victory	Kee-kee-kee! I won!

m038_10_true2	Everything I regard...is the object of my desire.
m038_10_true3	Can you...satisfy me?
m038_10_victory	I won.
m038_boss_long	I don't plan to lose.
m038_boss_short	Let's fight.
m038_ctskill	Hah!
m038_death_1	Ngh...

m039_true3	Stupid Master... If you don't get mad, you lose...\So I'll get mad...for you!
m039_victory	I killed them all...
m040_boss_long	Come on, you little worm.
m040_boss_short	Bring it.
m040_ctskill	These are the rules of the universe.
m040_death_1	This, too, is the will of the heavens.
m040_death_2	Ha-ha!
m040_drive	Why do you fight?
m040_hit_1	Hahaha.
m040_hit_2	Ooof.
m040_hit_3	Guh.
m040_prskill	Can you stand against fate?
m040_skill	You should learn to be more flexible.
m040_spa	I suppose the occasional moment like this isn't so bad.
m040_startbt	Is this the beginning of another meaningless battle?
m040_story1	It was the will of the heavens that I became your Child.
m040_story2	I suppose I still need more training.
m040_story3	Cast aside your desires.\The purer the desire, the more pain it will cause you.
m040_true1	The more you relinquish, the more you stand to gain.
m040_true2	You still have much you need to let go of. You lack discipline.
m040_true3	Cast away all desire. Only then will true peace find you.
m040_victory	Haha. You never know what surprises life has in store.
m045_00_boss_long	I want to hear you say you love me right now!
m045_00_boss_short	Love me!
m045_00_ctskill	Have eyes only for me!
m045_00_death_1	You threw me away... How dare you!

m045_story1	I'll stay with you for the rest of your life, so you'll never forget me!
m045_story2	My pactmaker's life is miserable because of that woman!\She's bawling! I won't forgive this!
m045_story3	You must speak only my name for the rest of your life!\Think only of me!

m049_boss_long	You fools! Bow down before genius!
m049_boss_short	Worship me!
m049_ctskill	Grrr!
m049_death_1	I was wrong?! I-Impossible... This calls for a new thesis...
m049_death_2	No... The truth yet eludes me...
m049_drive	I AM the truth!
m049_hit_1	Gah!
m049_hit_2	Fools...
m049_hit_3	Gaaah!
m049_prskill	You fool!
m049_skill	Click, clack...
m049_spa	Click, clack...
m049_startbt	You fools don't deserve to live... I must rectify this error!
m049_story1	Fools...\Fools!\How dare those pitiful fools criticize my thesis!
m049_story2	...I am not wrong. I am right.\It's those fools who refuse to understand...who CANNOT understand...who are wrong...
m049_story3	Fools...\You could never hope to understand.\I am a genius...
m049_true1	Hehehe... Behold this exquisite theorem!\My analysis is absolute! I am a true genius!
m049_true2	You say I'm mistaken? Tell me, in which part of which thesis do you see so much as a single error?\You couldn't possibly say? Then I'm right! Unequivocally!
m049_true3	How could I have possibly made an error? I'm a genius...\I'll kill every fool who ever doubted my intellect! Every last one of them...
m049_victory	That was a minute I'll never get back.
m050_boss_long	I can't wait to see who death chooses.
m050_boss_short	Who gets to die today?
m050_ctskill	Stick out your neck so I can make a clean cut.
m050_death_1	Not a bad way to go...
m050_death_2	Gaaah!
m050_drive	Reaper Blade!
m050_hit_1	Ah—
m050_hit_2	Aaah!
m050_hit_3	Guh!
m050_prskill	Black Sword!
m050_skill	Hrgh!
m050_spa	Those who disturb me during my time of rest will be swiftly beheaded...
m050_startbt	I'll chop off his head.
m050_story1	I'm going to chop off her head...
m050_story2	I have a request to make of you.\When I die, would you cut off my head?
m050_story3	In that case, I'll cut off your enemies' heads for you.

m190_true1	So much for making my wishes come true, liar.\I know! Why don't we find out what liars taste like?

m190_victory	Victory...tastes pretty good.

m191_true1	You have such an innocent face, Master.\The kind I can't get enough of, really. Heheheh...
m191_true2	It's not good to lie, you say? Well, of course not.\But you're a liar too, aren't you?
m191_true3	Let me give you some advice: The closer someone is to you, the more you should pay them no heed.\This world is full of liars, after all...

m192_story2	Such cool-headed intelligence and sincerity...wonderful.\I want you more than ever.
m192_story3	Are you attempting to ride this wave of chaos all the way to the throne? This is not the ideal path to greatness, but for one as incompetent as you, it's not half-bad.
m192_true1	Behold, the future Archfiend! Call in the royal musicians!\If they aren't to be found, then whistle!
m192_true2	Is this the extent of your ability,\even with a succubus as capable as Lisa by your side?
m192_true3	If we were to join forces, we could create an Infernal Realm the likes of which has never been seen!\Take my hand, incompetent demon.
m192_victory	A victory for the ages!
m193_boss_long	Do you hear a voice?

m245_boss_long	I am Creature, an unwanted soul...
m245_boss_short	I'm here to meet you.
m245_ctskill	I will break you!
m245_death_1	I'm Creature...\Don't you forget it...
m245_death_2	A-Ahh... I see...
m245_drive	Do NOT stand before me!
m245_hit_1	Now you've done it!
m245_hit_2	Ugh, I was careless.
m245_hit_3	Come at me, again!
m245_prskill	I'll show you my strength!
m245_skill	Now, my turn!
m245_spa	Wow, you're being so nice to me.\Thanks, Demon.
m245_startbt	I will retrieve my soul this time!
m245_story1	Your...Child?!\No, my name is... It's Creature!\My one and only name, given to me by the demon Babel!
m245_story2	If we asked our creator,\he could easily define us.
m245_story3	Demonic or not,\it doesn't matter!\What matters is, you are who you are!
m245_true1	I am Creature!\A monster abandoned by my creator!
m245_true2	Are you still running?\Lisa has been looking for you.\I'm happy to turn a blind eye, though.
m245_true3	I've no memories from before I was Creature.\But I do know there is a small bird inside us.
m245_victory	Where is my creator....
m255_boss_long	You have so much energy. Let me inflict some pain!
m255_boss_short	You've got energy.
m255_ctskill	It hurts?\Of course it does.
m255_death_1	This hurts more than I thought...
m255_death_2	I might just die this time.
m255_drive	There's no antidote!
m255_hit_1	Oughhh!
m255_hit_2	Huh. That all you got?
m255_hit_3	Teehee!
m255_prskill	You feel that instant effect?
m255_skill	You're gonna feel a prick!
m255_spa	*sigh* This place seems to help people get healthy...\and that gets under my skin like nothing else!
m255_startbt	You won't even feel the pain!
m255_story1	Good morning, Master.\You seem well.\Would you like me to inflict some pain?
m255_story2	I'll even throw in an energy drink.\The side effects are cold chills, vomiting, diarrhea, paralysis, and hives.\In bad cases, it could lead to death. But don't worry about all that.
m255_story3	Okay, you caught me red-handed.\I was going to kill you one drop at a time.
m255_true1	Feeling lousy isn't necessarily a bad thing.\Just live and let live.\Worry about your health later.
m255_true2	You found poison in my energy drink?\I hate demons who are smart alecs.
m255_true3	Have an energy drink.\Trust me, you don't want to know what's in it.
m255_victory	Thanks for stopping by! Come again!
m256_89_boss_long	If you beat me, Au'll acknowledge your strength, rora.

m256_89_hit_4	Aurorooo!

m256_89_prskill	Auroro, you scared?
m256_89_skill	Surrendora!
m261_88_boss_long	Now pray! Your wish might be granted, you know.
m261_88_boss_short	Did you just fall for it?
m261_88_bubble_prskill	It doesn't hurt, does it?
m261_88_bubble_skill	We'll always be together, just the two of us.
m261_88_ctskill	Put my back into it? I’d rather not.
m261_88_death_1	I can still take it.
m261_88_death_2	I'll be back. I promise!
m261_88_drive	I am Moa!
m261_88_hit_1	Are you going to abandon me?
m261_88_hit_2	Oh?
m261_88_hit_3	Gah!
m261_88_hit_4	Gah...
m261_88_hit_5	Teehee.
m261_88_hit_6	Ha!
m261_88_hit_7	Is that it?
m261_88_hit_8	Oh, no, so scary.
m261_88_hit_9	You won't get away with that!
m261_88_prskill	We'll always be together, just the two of us.
m261_88_skill	It doesn't hurt, does it?
m261_boss_long	Here's a question! Who do you think is the real Moa?
m261_boss_short	Hello. I'm Moa.
m261_ctskill	Put my back into it? I’d rather not.
m261_death_1	I can still take it.
m261_death_2	I'll be back. I promise!
m261_drive	I'll show you the real Moa!
m261_hit_1	Ngh!
m261_hit_2	Hahahaha!
m261_hit_3	I-I'm fine.
m261_prskill	Do you want to defeat us?
m261_skill	Who ever could I be?
m261_spa	The hot spring sure feels good.\Hey, why the long face, Moa?\Smile. Smile, I say!
m261_startbt	Shall we, Moa?
m261_story1	I don't know why, but all the other Moas have left.\However, I still have my Kind Moa here with me.\Ah, togetherness is such bliss! Don't you agree, Moa?
m261_story2	*sigh* Did you not hear a word I said?\Just forget those fa—\I mean, "friends" of yours and\stay here with me. Got it?
m261_story3	Please, help me get them back.\I don't care if they're mean to me.\They're still as much a part of Moa as I am!
m261_true1	Hehehe, I'm finally free!\Do you know how much I suffered locked up in the dark?!
m261_true2	I heard my friends.\But maybe it was just a dream.\Yeah, probably just imagining things.
m261_true3	You have to keep this a secret from Kind Moa!\There's no such thing as Moa.\Hahaha! Do you believe it?\Whether you do or don't is up to you, Master.
m261_victory	You didn't think we were gonna win, did you?
m264_88_boss_long	I'll swallow you whole.
m264_88_boss_short	Come at me all at once.
m264_88_bubble_prskill	This is it!
m264_88_bubble_skill	You're my prey.
m264_88_ctskill	I wonder how you taste.
m264_88_death_1	You got lucky.
m264_88_death_2	Dammit...
m264_88_drive	I'll show you a real demon.
m264_88_hit_1	Ugh!
m264_88_hit_2	Agh!
m264_88_hit_3	Hmpf!
m264_88_hit_4	Urgh!
m264_88_hit_5	What a joke.
m264_88_hit_6	Keep trying.

m264_89_bubble_prskill	This is it!
m264_89_bubble_skill	You're my prey.
m264_89_ctskill	I wonder how you taste.
m264_89_death_1	You got lucky.
m264_89_death_2	Dammit...

m264_89_skill	You're my prey.
m264_boss_long	You stink like Hell.
m264_boss_short	You didn't forget me, did you?
m264_ctskill	I wonder how you taste.
m264_death_1	You got lucky.
m264_death_2	Dammit...
m264_drive	I'll show you a real demon.
m264_hit_1	How dare you?
m264_hit_2	Oof!
m264_hit_3	Not a chance!
m264_prskill	Are you afraid of dying?
m264_skill	Get out of my sight!
m264_spa	You're a demon. I'm not thanking you\for treating me to a spa day.
m264_startbt	Let's get started.
m264_story1	You exploit and abandon us Childs\like we're garbage.
m264_story2	I'm not attached to any demon.\Say that again, and I'll swallow you.
m264_story3	What a jerk. I'm glad nothing happened.\Let's go. We're throwing a party to celebrate Kalaratri's new job.
m264_true1	Endless desire is the only thing I learned from you.\And I'm going to follow mine.
m264_true2	I'm not a demon, a human, or a Child.\I'm so confused... What do you think I am?
m264_true3	Don't underestimate me, demon. You may think Childs are your tools,\but we have pride.
m264_victory	Is it over already?
