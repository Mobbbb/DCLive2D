sc001_spa_1	Whew...\Nothing like a little self-care ♥
sc001_spa_2	Bodybuilding, combat training, cultivating a wicked and cunning mindset... You have so much to learn, Master. But just stick with me!
sc001_spa_3	You seem to be having more fun than usual. Have you finally relaxed?
sc001_spa_max	A demon who fails in everything he does. He struggles, but still flounders. That's why no one thinks highly of him. Even so, I think all the demons who meet Master end up cheering him on ♥
sc002_spa_1	Not working today?
sc002_spa_2	This is not the time to be lazing about in a place like this. Master is... No, never mind.
sc002_spa_3	We can take it easy today. If we're busy every day, we'll collapse.
sc002_spa_max	A smile suits you, Master. What? It's not like me to say that? Then I will show you an example. Though... Smiling doesn't come so easily to me either, I admit.
sc003_spa_1	Oh no you don't!\This area's off-limits to demons!
sc003_spa_2	Mona went away... Even though she promised she'd go with me.
sc003_spa_3	Master! No work today, huh? If you're off, then you should play with me!
sc003_spa_max	Today, we're gonna put stickers aaall over your room. Tomorrow, we'll play Archfiend! And the day after that, we'll play on the slide at the park! Let's play all week long! And you're coming with, Master!
sc004_spa_1	What do you wanna play tomorrow?
sc004_spa_2	Captaaain! I ran around all day, so now I'm super hungry! Eeeheehee!
sc004_spa_3	Running around alone is kinda depressing. I'd be sooo happy if you'd run around with me, Captain. Heehee...
sc004_spa_max	The captain's everything to me! Having him run around with me is my favorite thing in the world!
sc005_spa_1	Stay out of my way.
sc005_spa_2	You're still acting all high and mighty in a place like this? You're irritating. Go away!
sc005_spa_3	Don't you think the Childs here are too laid-back? We're in the middle of the Archfiend Contest! *sigh* Gimme a break...
sc005_spa_4	For some reason, I'm more exhausted than usual today. Guess it won't hurt me to take it easy for once.
sc005_spa_5	Listen. I'm an important asset to the team. Don't bug me while I'm relaxing. Give me some space here, and then I'll show you what I can REALLY do in the next fight.
sc005_spa_max	What're you all nervous for? Chill out. I'm actually pretty fond of this hot spring. Since you brought me to such a nice place, I'll go all out during the next battle.
sc007_spa_1	My, uh, shoulders were stiff... *ahem*
sc007_spa_2	It's always Firo, Firo, Firo! If you say that name in front of me one more time, I'll knock you into next week!
sc007_spa_3	The only ones who have a right to claim victory are the ones who focus on the here and now, who put everything they've got into fighting every single day
sc007_spa_max	You're still thinkin' about past defeats?! Idiot! As long as you've got me, you'll never lose again!
sc008_spa_1	It's time to begin your training!
sc008_spa_2	You're acting weird. You trying to make me let my guard down so you can betray me? Ha! Fat chance that'll ever happen.
sc008_spa_3	I like this hot spring. Except some loser keeps bugging me.
sc008_spa_4	It's true that hot springs are oddly calming. But don't get the wrong idea. My attitude's not gonna do a 180 just because you brought me here.
sc008_spa_max	Is it really okay to accept this kinda treatment? I don't know. Not that I really care. I'll just pay you back for it when I get to fighting again. Yeah?
sc009_spa_1	Don't think this show's for free.
sc009_spa_2	Sure, you tell me to rest up, but that's just because you're going to work me like a dog again, right? I'm gonna pay for this somehow, I'm sure.
sc009_spa_3	Quit fussing over me. That's not gonna make me trust you. ...What? We're friends? Hm... Then I guess I can trust you.
sc009_spa_4	I was getting tired of fighting anyway, so this is perfect timing. I'm gonna take it nice and easy for once.
sc009_spa_max	What? You're not telling me to get out already, are you? If you're gonna let me soak, at least lemme get a little pruny. That way I can fight better.
sc010_spa_1	Aaah, now THIS is what I call relaxation.
sc010_spa_2	Wow, this is a pretty good idea, especially for you, darling ♥ Though I love beauty salons and aromatherapy as well, you know.
sc010_spa_3	Ugh, whenever I get close, you run away! How long are you going to play hard to get?
sc010_spa_max	Ugh, the one who falls in love first loses, right? Buuut, when it comes to demons, there's no telling what could happen. So let's just see how this goes, darling ♥
sc011_spa_1	Is the reward for my efforts?
sc011_spa_2	This routine is essential for maintaining my health, so please don't bother me.
sc011_spa_3	I've never been to such a wonderful hot spring! ...What was that look for? You don't believe me? That's so mean, Mr. Demon!
sc011_spa_max	Hello, Mr. Demon. This is it! Today's the day I'm gonna make you say it! I'm sick and tired of waiting!
sc012_spa_1	Hey... Don't stare at me like that. It's...awkward.
sc012_spa_2	Can you really become Archfiend just by gathering Childs and nothing else? The more you have, the harder it'll be to control them, you know.
sc012_spa_3	You called, Captain? Seems you need my help. I guess I can lend you a hand.
sc012_spa_4	No matter how you cut it, you're not demon-like at all, Captain. You know, I think I might just be able to trust you.
sc012_spa_max	Don't let go of my hand. I'll do everything in my power to help you. And I'll ensure you become Archfiend.
sc013_spa_1	Won't resting too long leave us open to attack...?
sc013_spa_2	Whew... I feel a lot better now. My headache isn't as bad today. Yeah. That's only comparatively speaking, though.
sc013_spa_3	Um... It must be boring spending time with me. Don't you want to go talk to other Childs?
sc013_spa_4	I knew you'd come. You're definitely stubborn, I'll give you that. Anyway, did something happen? I have plenty of time, so I'll hear you out.
sc013_spa_max	Why don't we talk about love? The speed of light is the only thing that's constant. That's why saying "you're my light" is the pinnacle of romantic expression.
sc014_spa_1	What a magnificent place. Thank you, Master.
sc014_spa_2	Don't listen to their absurd claims! You're not meant to be wicked, Master.
sc014_spa_3	If I must perish to uphold justice, then I shall face death without fear. ...Why are you so angry?
sc014_spa_4	I aspire to be like you, Master. If I follow your example, one day I'll be reborn as a true guardian of justice.
sc014_spa_5	I am your disciple, Master. I shall dispense justice in whatever fashion you dictate. Now, please tell me what kind of world you desire.
sc014_spa_max	There is no need for you to suffer, Master. Simply walk your own path, as you have been doing. I will follow along behind you.
sc017_spa_1	It's like I'm melting away\...in a good way...
sc017_spa_2	Did you come to soak too, Master? I must've drifted off at some point. *yaaawn* I'm awake now, but I think I'll take another nap.
sc017_spa_3	Master! Wanna play fetch with me today? Or do you wanna play in the water?
sc017_spa_max	I played my heart out, so I was totally pooped. But I feel tons better now! Thanks for bringing me to the hot spring. Whaddaya wanna play today, Master?
sc018_spa_1	Eeep. You didn't see anything, right?
sc018_spa_2	You came to see me? I don't believe you. You came to see some other Child, right? Demons are so untrustworthy, I swear.
sc018_spa_3	Um, you'll sing a song to Daron again today, right? Huh? Your face turned bright red. Did you catch a cold?
sc018_spa_4	Heehee... I got complimented again today! I'm in a great mood, so I'll keep helping you out!
sc018_spa_max	I could've fought harder, but I don't wanna get hurt, and I hate being in pain. I can't deny that I wanna help you, though.
sc019_spa_1	Do you bathe often?
sc019_spa_2	Who said you could speak to me? Wait quietly until I've finished bathing.
sc019_spa_3	Hm? Just checking in while you're here? What kind of demon does that? Whatever. I guess it won't kill me to say hello.
sc019_spa_max	You don't honestly think that by bringing me to a hot spring, you've fulfilled your duty, do you? If you want me to recognize you as my master, then act in a way that pleases me. Then I'll accept you.
sc020_spa_1	Well, hello there, little one. You're more precocious than I expected.
sc020_spa_2	Don't you think you're being conceited, thinking you're so great just because you brought me to a place like this? Other demons would put your immature sensibilities to shame.
sc020_spa_3	I never knew that demons loved hot springs too.　I guess we have more in common than I thought. Could it be that my fate is entwined with yours?
sc020_spa_4	I knew my dice weren't wrong! They predicted I'd have good fortune in the near future, but I never expected anything this awesome.
sc020_spa_max	Good rest leads to good fortune, you know! Prepare yourself for greatness, little one, because I'm going to fight with everything I've got.
sc022_spa_1	Oh man, I love AR stuff!\There's an awesome hot springs event happening right now!
sc022_spa_2	We're going back already? You're so stingy. Just leave me alone if you don't wanna play. "Take this! My ultimate technique!" Ugh, c'mon, would it kill you to play along?
sc022_spa_3	What's with the long face? Heh heh... Did you get scolded by one of your aides again? Quit whining and let's play a game! ...And relax in the hot spring, I guess.
sc022_spa_4	You came running to me again? You're seriously pathetic. Well, don't sweat it. I won't tell your aides! You owe me one, got it?
sc022_spa_max	Don't be humming a victory theme just 'cuz you brought me to a hot spring. It's pathetic. Though I guess I'm kinda grateful. Kthx...
sc026_spa_1	Here, Mr. Devil! I'll make sure you're nice and clean. Hahaha!
sc026_spa_2	You said it wasn't hot! You lied! You're horrible! I can't believe this! Oh, but it DOES feel kinda nice... Anyway, you're still a jerk! You big dummy!
sc026_spa_3	Do you like being tickled, Mr. Devil? I love being tickled. Heehee... C'mere, Mr. Devil! Mr. Deeeviiil...
sc026_spa_4	*sigh* I'm so warm. I feel all heavy. So sleepy... Mr. Devil, you better look after me until I wake up.
sc026_spa_max	You're not gonna soak, Mr. Devil? But it's so nice and warm. No need to hold back for my sake—get in here already! If you don't, I'll tickle you!
sc027_spa_1	Clash of hot springs!
sc027_spa_2	Are you lost? This is our first encounter, but I'm glad to have met you.
sc027_spa_3	It was well worth fighting for you. I never thought you'd introduce me to someplace so wonderful. Don't get the wrong idea, though. I didn't fight hard just for a reward. I'll come to your aid whenever you call.
sc027_spa_max	The legendary hero Cynthia won't ever fight for a demon! Buuut! She will put her life on the line for a dear friend!
sc028_spa_1	Ahhh, that feels good ♥ H-Hey, what do you think you're doing here?! Only princes are fit to gaze upon me!
sc028_spa_2	Hey, what're you doing over there? If you've got free time, come here and gimme a massage, or buy me something cold to drink.
sc028_spa_3	Someone! Anyone! Is no one around? How dare you use me, Princess Leda, so horribly! And then you think you can worm out of your punishment by sending me to a hot spring? Well...gracious as I am, I suppose I can overlook your insolence just this once.
sc028_spa_4	Hmmm. Rumor has it that you've been bragging about me to everyone. Please try to tone it down a little! I detest idiotic servants!
sc028_spa_max	Do I HAVE to say I like it? Fine. If you want to know my answer, I'll tell you: The water temperature, humidity, water quality, and attending servants are all to my liking. Heehee!
sc029_spa_1	My, I can see the moon reflected in the water. Exquisite...
sc029_spa_2	You say you don't want me wandering off anymore since you brought me to a hot spring? But you obviously bring other Childs to this very same place. You're so selfish.
sc029_spa_3	Soaking in hot water make me zone out and forget how much time has passed. So please, keep talking to me.
sc029_spa_4	This place is lovely. Just what I'd expect from one of your recommendations, Master. The next time we go out, we should come here. Shh—I've already made up my mind, so I won't tolerate any backtalk.
sc029_spa_max	You seem to be in low spirits today. Show me the darkness lingering in your heart, and I'll illuminate it for you. How, you ask? Heehee... That's a secret.
sc030_spa_1	Hm. This is a tough case to crack. I might not be able to solve it.
sc030_spa_2	Hold up. I need to focus. It's hard to deal with societal problems. Why, you ask? Because you need to predict how culture is shifting.
sc030_spa_3	Assistant. Why have you been listening in silence this whole time? A detective's heart can only be moved by a fascinating case!
sc030_spa_4	Assistant. How long have we known each other now? I think it's about time we partnered up!
sc030_spa_max	Once upon a time, there was a detective who lost her parents. The detective searched for her parents' murderer. Eventually, she came to the conclusion that the culprit was a demon. After that, in order to exact her revenge, she became a demon herself. ...Well? Interesting story, right?
sc031_spa_1	I may be a cat...\But I also love hot water...
sc031_spa_2	When Meowster is sad, his tail droops. Just like me-ow. That's why I understand how my meowster feels!
sc031_spa_3	I like hot water, but... normal kitties don't. So if a kitty goes in the bath with you, Meowster, it means you've impurressed them somehow.
sc031_spa_max	Meowna has taught me-ow a lot. I... I'm a Child, so I gotta help my meowster!
sc032_spa_1	I used the hot spring water to make this soft-boiled egg for you, master.
sc032_spa_2	You've come again? Hm? You say I seem perturbed? Not at all. The only thing I'm upset about is being interrupted while I'm resting.
sc032_spa_3	Please feel free to speak up anytime you are exhausted. I will always remain by your side to help you.
sc032_spa_max	The best sort of maid is one who stays out of their master's sight! I don't mind if that's hard for people to grasp. So long as YOU understand, that's fine by me.
sc033_spa_1	I can feel my heart rejuvenating.
sc033_spa_2	What brings you here today? You're not here to keep an eye on me, are you? You really shouldn't worry. I'm just here to enjoy the hot springs.
sc033_spa_3	I've been awaiting your arrival most anxiously, Master. Why, you ask? Simple: Because I enjoy spending quality time　with you like this.
sc033_spa_max	All the Childs here are the objects of your affection... Myself included, of course.
sc034_spa_1	H-Hmph... You really MUST be a demon, to come traipsing in here so shamelessly.
sc034_spa_2	What's wrong? You seem pretty worn out. Everyone needs a break now and then, you know.
sc034_spa_3	It's been a while since I've taken this much time off. Guess it doesn't hurt to enjoy ourselves like this sometimes. Surely you agree?
sc034_spa_max	You take good care of me— that much I get. That's why you bring me out here, right? Well, I appreciate it.
sc035_spa_1	I would like to...negotiate with the owner of this hot spring...
sc035_spa_2	To think there's a place this beautiful, but that only certain Childs are allowed to visit it. It's really unfair. Maybe there's just a limit on total world happiness, or something?
sc035_spa_3	Whenever you show me kindness, Master, I can't help but imagine what sort of blunder it is you're trying to cover up. Could it be that you're showing legitimate affection for once?
sc035_spa_4	If only everyone could see you the way I see you. You're such a wonderful person, so why does everyone insist on hassling you?
sc035_spa_max	You just wait. I'll make the Infernal Realm greater than ever— all in your name, Master.
sc036_spa_1	So what if he's a stuffed animal? Bear-Bear still loves taking baths. Right, Bear-Bear?
sc036_spa_2	I can't believe you've been keeping this place all to yourself. Did you really think you could hide it from me? You wicked demon, you.
sc036_spa_3	Hey, how much do you want for this place? It's a hot spring just for Childs, right? That's gotta be pretty rare! I want this place SO bad!
sc036_spa_4	There's lots of stuff in your room that really catches my eye. How do you feel about selling some of it off to me? I'll pay you market value! No, better!
sc036_spa_5	What I want more than anything is to get my hands on a real one-of-a-kind item. What do I have in mind, you ask? Well...I'm still figuring that part out.
sc036_spa_max	Hmm, so, listen. I hate to say this, but... I doubt you'd be able to fit inside Bear-Bear here. Ever thought about dieting?
sc037_spa_1	Come on, kid. This isn't nearly enough to get me fired up.
sc037_spa_2	I don't give a damn whether you take part in the Archfiend Contest or not. All I wanna do is take down anyone who rubs me the wrong way.
sc037_spa_3	Gimme a break, kid. Quit moping around and trying to read my mood. If you just promise to serve me, I'll take extra good care of ya.
sc037_spa_max	When the time comes, we'll see who's really cut out to be Archfiend. You know, until now, I never felt like anyone else even stood a chance. We'll just have to wait and see who wins: you or me.
sc038_spa_1	Um, hellooo? How long have you been staring from over there?
sc038_spa_2	Gosh, what is UP with this place? Everyone's just out here bragging up a storm about their masters... Not that I can't relate, with a wonderful master of my own and all.
sc038_spa_3	Oh, come on, Master! Show me a little love! This hot spring date of ours is really making me burn up inside!
sc038_spa_4	Hey, hey! Check this out! ♥ All that time in the hot springs has done wonders for my skin! ♥ Get ready, 'cause I think I'm set to be more adorable than ever! ♥
sc038_spa_5	A date at the hot springs is great and all, but... I'd sure love to hit up some other spots, yeah? I know! Since you were nice enough to bring me out here, next time I'll take you to one of my favorite date spots! ♥
sc038_spa_max	Master! ♥ Do you know what day it is? It's the anniversary of the first day we met! ♥ And since this is our special day, don't you even think about leaving my side, 'kay?
sc039_spa_1	I-I'll hit you if you keep staring like that...
sc039_spa_2	What, you thought I'd have something nice to say to you? Spare me your humorless jokes! Now get out of my sight before you poison the air with another!
sc039_spa_3	The only way anyone sees me without my makeup on is with my express permission! Now quit standing around there and just... go away and wait somewhere else! And quit staring!
sc039_spa_4	You seem to be getting the wrong idea. The reason why I always seem so irritated isn't because I hate you, or anything like that, okay? It's just embarrassing!
sc039_spa_max	Not again... No matter how many times I tell you off, you never give up. Rain or shine, you're always coming by to check in on me. Creep! Hmph. What did I ever do to deserve this? Quit skulking around here and get lost.
sc040_spa_1	Peeping on me in the bath?\You really are evil.
sc040_spa_2	What do I wish for? Nothing. But if I HAD to wish for something, it would be for you carry yourself like more of a true master. But that's nothing to waste a wish on, is it?
sc040_spa_3	You're worried because your Childs don't all behave the way you want them to, right? You can relax, though. You still have loyal Childs like me.
sc040_spa_max	Why do you seem so worried about the look on my face? Sure, I guess it's not a rainbow of emotions... But that doesn't mean I've got an emotionless heart. Relax.
sc041_spa_1	Muah.
sc041_spa_2	The louder a cur's bark, the more pathetic its bite. A truly fierce beast always sits by quietly, waiting for the right moment to strike and take down its prey.
sc041_spa_3	You must've been born under a lucky star to end up with a Child as wondrous as yours truly. Has it ever crossed your mind that maybe you've used up your entire life's worth of luck getting me, short stuff?
sc041_spa_max	I hear you confronted quite the fearsome opponent recently. Care to explain why you didn't take me with you? If you had, you would have seen just how hard I'd fight for you...
sc043_spa_1	O-M-G! This feels sooo good!
sc043_spa_2	Maybe I misjudged you. I didn't think you were capable of treating me to something so nice. Hey, now! Don't give me that stupid smirk!
sc043_spa_3	I've seen plenty of Childs out there, but I'm definitely the cutest of the bunch! And you—you're one lucky demon for getting your hands on me! ♪
sc043_spa_4	Haha... I thought I'd toughen up once I got older and all, but seeing how weak I am now, maybe I've still got a lot of growing up to do.
sc043_spa_5	That was one heck of a battle we had today. Time to let all that built-up tension out in these hot springs. Keep up the good work!
sc043_spa_max	What? You wanna know if I like it here? 'Course I do! I'm down for a place like this 24/7, 365! Make sure you bring me along again! You hear me, my little demon friend? ★
sc044_spa_1	S-So hot... I think my blood pressure's spiking...
sc044_spa_2	Well, well, well. The stars must have aligned for us to run into each other here. Honestly, I never thought our paths would ever cross. Haha, no, I only kid.
sc044_spa_3	I've put my trust in you. I mean, yes, it's true that you're the only one I could have put it in, but...
sc044_spa_4	Slipping into these steamy springs is enough to rejuvenate anyone— even someone like me. I could get used to this.
sc044_spa_5	Is it just me, or does everyone here seem wrapped up in some sort of competition? Is it one of endurance? I have to wonder why, since everything is moving according to plan. Hmm? What does that mean, you ask? What indeed...?
sc044_spa_max	Those succubi gave you another scolding, did they? You seem down, but you really shouldn't be. You're a much better candidate than I gave you credit for. Have some faith in yourself.
sc045_spa_1	This is so refreshing!
sc045_spa_2	Yikes... This place is stuffed to the gills with my rivals. Like that girl there. And that one there... I better stay on top of my game!
sc045_spa_3	Master! Hot springs are supposed to be quiet places! I know you're my superfan and all, but you're actually super-lame for making it SO obvious with all the noise you're making.
sc045_spa_4	Hey, guess what! I just bumped into a fan of mine. I went ahead and gave them my autograph, and— Hey! Oh, I see, you don't believe me, huh? E-Even though I'm... *sniff* ...always working so hard...
sc045_spa_5	A nice soak is something any chart-topping pop star deserves every now and again, right? This is all part of a learning experience! I mean, it's supposed to be, at least. Mostly, I'm just enjoying the vibe.
sc045_spa_max	You'll join me up there one day, right, Master? Up on stage, taking in the cheering, beaming crowd, overcome with emotion and excitement...
sc047_spa_1	I hate water.\I always end up making it evaporate...
sc047_spa_2	Hey! I got excited when I heard this was a hot spring just for Childs, but this water's hardly even warm!
sc047_spa_3	Did you chase me all the way here? You really are the worst...
sc047_spa_4	Phew... I haven't felt this free in ages! Not a soul around to bother— Oh, it's you. I'll just pretend I didn't see you there. Go on, then. Get lost.
sc047_spa_5	What's with the dumb grin on your face? Hmmm... Well, you know what? You have a nice smile. I'll...take back calling it dumb.
sc047_spa_max	It's such a pain to always have to come out here, listening to you whine and moan like you do. Still...I'm your Child, and you ARE my master, so I suppose I can let it slide.
sc048_spa_1	You thought this would make me happy? Hah...
sc048_spa_2	Hm? What's with that face? I think you've got the wrong idea. I'm just trying to enjoy myself here, so could you leave me alone? Or better yet, just leave entirely?
sc048_spa_3	What do you want TODAY, of all days? I'm no succubus, okay? I'm off the clock, for the record. Have I made myself clear? Good. Now make yourself scarce. Shoo.
sc048_spa_4	I think maybe I was wrong about... well, all of this. I don't think I like any of it. Hmph... Why even have an event like this? Can we just skip through all of it?
sc048_spa_max	I wasn't in the best of moods today. Or yesterday, even. Or the day before. I'm never in a good mood, honestly. That's just the way I am, I guess. Not that I ever asked to be this way...
sc049_spa_1	Ahhh... This, too, helps me feel at peace...
sc049_spa_2	This sulfuric stench... We must surely be in the depths of hell. Be that as it may, it matters little. My faith will not be shaken that easily.
sc049_spa_3	Our Lord once said, "Lift up your hands and hold them to the sea." "The seas shall part, and you shall walk on dry ground." ...N-No, I'm definitely not quoting scripture as an excuse to play in the water!
sc049_spa_4	I refuse to submit to your demonic temptations. But if your occasional displays of affection are truly rooted in kindness... Well, then I find no problem with that.
sc049_spa_5	To think you'd just leave me here! What if I were to run away? You're a reckless demon, you know. But perhaps that's also why I feel so...unthreatened. Like we're growing less and less distant.
sc049_spa_max	The kindness you show comes from a place of righteousness. So please, don't fight it. Our Lord forgives all, even demons. Now bring your hands together, and let us say a prayer. One for your salvation...
sc051_spa_1	Isn't this supposed to be hot?
sc051_spa_2	Hey, now that we're here, we might as well enjoy ourselves! Bet you don't have the luxury of kicking back, though, do ya? Bahaha!
sc051_spa_3	Listen, I've been thinking, and I really don't see you making much progress from here on. Oh, what? You mad? You are, aren't ya?
sc051_spa_4	Jeez, you're a real pain, you know that? If you've got time to get all buddy-buddy here, shouldn't you be out finding more pactmakers? Or should I take it you don't have any leads, since you're just hanging around here killing time?
sc051_spa_5	What makes a good demon? Why would I ever answer that? We're enemies in this, remember? Wait, no, not enemies—rivals! Yeah, that's it, we're rivals!
sc051_spa_max	You don't look busy. Got a minute? Good, then listen, I gotta tell you something. It's about my future plans! First! I'm gonna be Archfiend! Second! I'm gonna incite a revolution! Over what, I haven't decided yet, but still... Sounds cool, right?
sc052_spa_1	I know I'm fiendishly attractive,\but could you not stare quite so much?
sc052_spa_2	Oh my... Look at all the innocent little sheep that flock here. If all goes well, I might get myself a few more followers for the Church of Berit.
sc052_spa_3	I don't get it. My smooth-talking should work on pretty much anyone, but all the Childs here just keep calling me "adorable." Why?
sc052_spa_max	Hey, where have you been, Master? You've got some gall, leaving a guy like me hanging. Pull that again and you'll be sorry. ...Not that I imagine you'd make the same mistake twice. Not you.
sc053_spa_1	You just had a dirty thought, didn't you?
sc053_spa_2	Shh. Stop. Your thoughts are depressing me.
sc053_spa_3	You worry over too many pointless things. And the more you fret over them, the more your whole mind is consumed by them. It's tiresome. So please, can you try to meditate or something to silence that brain of yours?
sc053_spa_4	You want me to guess what's on your mind right now? No thank you. I don't want to read your mind; I want to hear the answer in your own words.
sc053_spa_5	This hot spring? I love it. But you just interpreted what I said as simple flattery, right? Have a little more faith in what I say. I would never tell a lie.
sc053_spa_max	This place is a bit quieter than most. I wouldn't mind coming back.
sc054_spa_1	There is no moment more dangerous than when you let down your guard.\Keep your wits about you.
sc054_spa_2	Hm! I sense that there are a number of Childs hiding in these waters! That is why the spring has been overflowing all this time. I shall have to dispatch them quietly.
sc054_spa_3	Muster up some courage. You are destined to become Archfiend someday. Of this I am sure.
sc054_spa_max	There are no bonds greater than those forged on the field of battle. You and I have such a bond. I even know how to take such a connection to greater heights...
sc056_spa_1	I can feel strength welling up inside me! The next time we meet shall be the last!
sc056_spa_2	I only answer to one master: no less than the almighty Himself. Demons exist solely to be eliminated.
sc056_spa_3	Don't you think you fuss over me too much? Don't blame me if that gets you purified when you're not paying attention! No, I kid.
sc056_spa_max	Oh wicked demon, toss away your earthly desires and awaken to your true, heavenly calling. Do so, and even a demon like you may earn His forgiveness.
sc057_spa_1	This sort of thing can be nice from time to time...
sc057_spa_2	Hello there, my precious customer. Have you set time aside just for me? Well, how sweet. What sort of tales have you got for me today, hmm?
sc057_spa_3	Well, well. Look who's here. Just the face I wanted to see. I was just thinking of you, you know. Why, you ask? Well...
sc057_spa_4	Every now and then, I like to just sit here doing nothing for a nice, long while. What do I think about while I'm at it? Well...I'm a demon follower, yes? So demons, of course!
sc057_spa_5	Another rough day out there? Don't bother trying to pretend otherwise—it's written all over your face. You're like an open book. You're a one-of-a-kind demon in that regard— the only innocent, inexperienced, tiny little demon out there.
sc057_spa_max	Hello there, my cute little customer. How nice of you to sneak out again to see little ol' me. How can I tell? Hee-hee. It's written all over your face.
sc058_spa_1	All becomes duty when neglected...
sc058_spa_2	There's something I was meant to do. Something about my name, my task, my fate? Do you know?
sc058_spa_3	若是経典所在之処, 即為有佛, 若尊重弟子. "This scripture is found in a holy land. Being able to explain its nuance is the border that separates disciple from master."
sc058_spa_4	Do I harbor a grudge against you, you ask? I wonder. To begrudge you would mean to have an attachment to the living, which would, in turn, define me as one among their number. Hm. Mayhap I do after all.
sc058_spa_5	Something springs to mind. The words and thoughts flow from my mouth, unbidden, to express something I struggle to define. Do you not think it strange?
sc058_spa_max	If I lead you to Nirvana, and you, as my companion, become one with me, then it would mean I am not among the dead, rendering all else mere pretense.
sc060_spa_1	Care to join me, baby?
sc060_spa_2	You're putting me in a tough spot by trusting me, baby. Why, you ask? 'Cause I don't trust you. Not one bit.
sc060_spa_3	You look like you've got one foot in the grave. Your aides giving you a hard time? Hee-hee. Poor baby.
sc060_spa_4	Wow, baby, you're doing amazing! Did you work really hard today? Why don't you show me this side of you more often?
sc060_spa_max	I don't think you'll always be down and out, baby. You just keep putting your best foot forward. It's bound to pay off one day.
sc061_spa_1	This should inspire some great melodies ♪
sc061_spa_2	Getting to know someone comes with its fair share of "eureka" moments. For example, I've learned that you're a total loner, Mr. Demon— and you don't find many demons like that!
sc061_spa_3	YEAAAH! ♪ Wanna rock out today? Come on, I know you can do it! Even a demon can figure it out. Just keep your eyes fixed on the path ahead, and you'll be good.
sc061_spa_4	I know we're kind of using this space as an excuse to talk, but there's nothing to say. After all, I'm always an open book with you, Mr. Demon! You, on the other hand, love to keep your secrets, don't you?
sc061_spa_5	You're so forward today! Did you have a change of heart? Haha, I'm just messing with you! You weren't about to start avoiding me, were you? Can't you take a little joke? People will think you're a stick in the mud.
sc061_spa_max	Thanks for always thinking of me! You really care about me, don't you? Hee-hee. Well, the feeling's mutual. It has been ever since the day we first met.
sc062_spa_1	Hee-hee, are you here to peep on me? I guess I can't blame you, given my beauty ♥
sc062_spa_2	Hey! You can't just barge in here! I get wanting to come and see me, but you have to observe proper decorum. Understood?
sc062_spa_3	Hey, Demon, do you remember the day we met? Ah, that day— Hold on a second. I can see it in your eyes. You don't remember at all, do you?!
sc062_spa_4	Demon, you're so clueless about women. But you know what? It's okay. I'm the only woman you need to know.
sc062_spa_max	Ahhh, this feels so good. I could just stay in the spa all day. ...Aww, are you sad that I'm not paying attention to you? Oh, Demon, you're so adorable ♥
sc063_spa_1	O-Oh, hi, demon.\I should have brought my diary...
sc063_spa_2	You startled me, showing up out of nowhere.
sc063_spa_3	Could you come a little closer? I'm not good at speaking up. B-But I really do want to talk to you.
sc063_spa_4	Do you still find it difficult to approach me? I want to get to know you better.
sc063_spa_max	I can't live without you. And now you're calling me a burden? How could you?!
sc064_spa_1	A swordsman who doesn't know how to sharpen a sword is a fool who will know only defeat.
sc064_spa_2	I expected to see you show some growth, but all you do is bore me.
sc064_spa_3	You have to be able to keep up with me. I'm not so gentle as to take care of anyone lagging behind.
sc064_spa_4	How long are you going to let your weakness drag you down? If you've got enough ambition to become the Archfiend, then prove it!
sc064_spa_5	I've never heard of anyone getting things done by overthinking. You need only focus on a single question: Who do you want to be?
sc064_spa_max	Fame is not yours to hoard. It should be shared among everyone supporting and fighting alongside you, myself included.
sc065_spa_1	Aaah...\Care to join me, boy?
sc065_spa_2	Does the fragrance of freshly-cut roses tickle my nose? Perhaps someone put some in the bath. Oh-ho-ho-ho ♥ How charming! ♥
sc065_spa_3	You desire to know what makes me so irresistible? Oh-ho-ho-ho. Are you playing coy to slide your way into my heart?
sc065_spa_4	I wish you would do something to change this somber atmosphere.
sc065_spa_max	I don't care for love. It's little more than fooling around in secret. But if you insist on experiencing it for yourself, then I can show you something quite...similar.
sc066_spa_1	Isn't this a little too...vulnerable?
sc066_spa_2	Oh, you're here, too? I wanted to spend today relaxing on my own, if you don't mind.
sc066_spa_3	Your magic power is so feeble that I can barely sense it. If I were you, I'd pretty much sit still trying not to squander what little I have. But you clearly don't understand that, being a child and all.
sc066_spa_4	I can't get enough of messing with stupid demons lately. They're such easy targets. What are you laughing about? You're one of them, for the record.
sc066_spa_max	I do my job, but otherwise I try not to overexert my body. Not exactly a paragon of health here. Get what I'm saying? Be careful how you use me.
sc067_spa_1	I suppose it's nice to forget about death for a moment every once in a while.
sc067_spa_2	Life is a prison. And the key to eternal freedom...is death.
sc067_spa_3	You want me to sit here and wait for time to pass? Why wait? Join me, and together, we can end this boring life right here and now.
sc067_spa_4	I long for only one thing: death. Yet when I am here, I have this strange notion that there's more to life than endless suffering.
sc067_spa_5	Life is a multifaceted thing, yet its ultimate and final end is death. Do not neglect the life you have.
sc067_spa_max	Demons... Childs... They all understand the relationship between life and death, yet we are all alone in the end. So be it. If you choose life, then I shall too.
sc068_spa_1	Once I get out,\I'm making my Ambrosia Special Milkshake!
sc068_spa_2	You want to know my secret ingredient? The key word here is "secret," you know. ...Oh, what the heck, I'll tell you. What makes me so special is...my innate talent!
sc068_spa_3	I prepared an extra-special, extra-sweet treat for you! Are you excited, or what?
sc068_spa_4	What do you mean you're not sure about the flavor? That can't be right. Okay, next time I'm gonna make you a treat so good, your jaw will drop!
sc068_spa_max	Let me show you the secret sauce I put in my special Ambrosia dessert. That's right! It's the oh-so-sweet emotion found in girls who are shy about meeting their demons: first love! ♥
sc069_spa_1	Fancy meeting you here.
sc069_spa_2	All the other Childs have such cool masters. Why does mine have to be so... so... Well, like THIS?
sc069_spa_3	You're actually pretty crafty, aren't you, Master? You usually give off this idiotic vibe, but when it comes down to the wire, you always pull through.
sc069_spa_max	Hey! Are you okay with being a wannabe forever? Master, I know you're a way better candidate than most out there. Start acting like it!
sc072_spa_1	I mustn't let my guard down...
sc072_spa_2	Be honest, kid. You don't trust me, do you?
sc072_spa_3	Hey, kid, don't go off on your own like that. Jeez, what am I gonna do with you? Who knows what you might get yourself into?
sc072_spa_4	It's not like I'm watching your back so you'll thank me. ...What? No, I'm not embarrassed. It's just— Wait. Are you making fun of me?
sc072_spa_max	Look, I know you're probably sick of me being so overbearing. But it's my job to protect you. It's what I was born to do.
sc073_spa_1	This seems fine.
sc073_spa_2	Futile. Becoming a Child... Fighting... Everything is futile.
sc073_spa_3	Why must I live life to the fullest? I may be safe today, but what about tomorrow? Nobody knows what is to come.
sc073_spa_4	You obstinate demon. You do naught but complain. And yet you still bother with me.
sc073_spa_5	If all ends in emptiness, then I should at least do what I want, and chase my dreams.
sc073_spa_max	I'm a sluggard and a coward. If you don't lead the way, I'll simply have to stay right here.
sc074_spa_1	Liar!\You said this would feel good, but it's just a bunch of hot water!
sc074_spa_2	Mr. Demon! Did you forget again? The one I like is Ms. Mona, not you! ...Hey, what's with that face? Are you sulking?
sc074_spa_3	Mr. Demon! A little birdie told me that you think my cheering is annoying. Well? Be honest with me.
sc074_spa_4	Doing the same cheer is bound to get old, so I'm trying out a new version! All right, heeere goes! ...Hey, why are you plugging your ears?
sc074_spa_max	I'm surprised you're not brimming with energy every day from all the cheering I do. And the way you persevere in the face of such overwhelming laziness? It's amazing! ...Well? How's that for sarcasm?
sc082_spa_1	C-Can't say I was expecting this. I thought I'd be going in alone...
sc082_spa_2	Humans call the kind of relationship we have "friendship," right? I think I like that better than "Master and Child"!
sc082_spa_3	You're not actually a loner deep down, are you? Call it a hunch. If you really preferred being alone, you wouldn't spend so much time with your Childs.
sc082_spa_4	Oh, there you are. I had a feeling you were coming, so I've been expecting you for a while. My intuition's pretty spot-on, eh?
sc082_spa_max	I was thinking about how we met. Some might say it was the hand of fate at work. What would you call it, Master?
sc083_spa_1	What's on your mind, Daddy? Your face is all red.
sc083_spa_2	Why you mad? 'Cause my bazooka blasts—severely—and yours don't? It's just a little cannon fire! Don't be such a wimp!
sc083_spa_3	I'm basically just a kid, so you should be nicer to me, Daddy.
sc083_spa_4	So much lecturing lately. I don't have any practical skills? Well, it's only because I take after YOU so much, Daddy.
sc083_spa_max	Children grow from their parents' love. You need to give me lots more love, okay, Daddy? ♥
sc086_spa_1	Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub! *chomp*
sc086_spa_2	Do you have a stomachache? Wait, that stain on your shirt... You didn't eat the food I accidentally put frog poison into, did you?
sc086_spa_3	I'm always trying to come up with recipes you might like, Mr. Demon. This time, I started with bat claw soup, and then boiled some lizard tongues...
sc086_spa_max	Oh, me? I'm full just from watching you eat the food I make, Mr. Demon.
sc090_spa_1	Well? Come on in already.
sc090_spa_2	Repeat after me: GLORY TO VULCAN! *ahem* I can't hear you! Your proclamations are too quiet!
sc090_spa_3	There's only one way to make my greatness known far and wide, and that is for you to become the Archfiend!
sc090_spa_max	If you really are an Archfiend candidate, then you will stand up straight and walk proudly like one.
sc091_spa_1	Aaah... I haven't felt so relaxed in a long time.
sc091_spa_2	Master, I'll protect you,\no matter what.\You're still too weak.
sc091_spa_3	Are you uncomfortable with me helping you?\Well, too bad.\You remain too weak.
sc091_spa_4	One day, your generosity\will be your undoing, Master.
sc091_spa_5	Don't be afraid of presenting me tasks.\I exist to fulfill your will.
sc091_spa_max	As I exist for you,\you exist for me, Master.\How could I not\protect you?
sc095_spa_1	Aaah, I can almost feel my body melting away...
sc095_spa_2	Hmm, why is my master such a weakling? He always avoids sparring with me. Is it my destiny to be perpetually disappointed?
sc095_spa_3	Compared to other demons, Master's teachings are as unusual as they are difficult to follow. Still, I will put everything I have into internalizing them!
sc095_spa_max	So, you finally decided to spar with me. I hope you're ready! I'm gonna fight with everything I've got! This match'll be one for the history books!
sc099_spa_1	Lounging around a hot spring? This isn't metal at all!
sc099_spa_2	You should be thankful we met! If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't even know what true demonic spirit looks like!
sc099_spa_3	Oldies aren't my thing, but hey, if a fellow demon's into it, I'll give anything a shot. ...Huh? What the hell? Is this that idiot Aria's music? Dammit! She got me again!
sc099_spa_4	Stop fighting it. Embrace the spirit of metal! Hahaha! Nice—it suits you more than I thought it would!
sc099_spa_max	Muse said music is a conversation between souls. Perk up those ears and hear what my heart's got to say.
sc101_spa_1	Yeeeow, hot!
sc101_spa_2	Evil fiend! Messenger of hell! D-Don't come any closer!
sc101_spa_3	You're just trying to lead me down the path to evil! Well, it won't work! I won't listen to demons.
sc101_spa_4	I always believed that no one is born evil.
sc101_spa_5	Can a demon become kind if it learns to love? If I could rid your heart of evil, maybe you'd transform into something kind and pure...like an angel.
sc101_spa_max	So, even demons get lonely. You look like you need someone to care for you. Maybe I could help?
sc106_spa_1	What a wonderful place you've taken me to...\Maybe I can trust you a bit after all.
sc106_spa_2	By the way, I think I see a monkey-looking demon. Oh my, did you hear that? Hee-hee.
sc106_spa_3	I can't spend the rest of my life as some demon's Child. I have my own life to lead, after all. But until then, I'll help you however I can.
sc106_spa_max	Oh my! When did you and Watson start getting along? I'm a little jealous. Hm? It's not what it looks like, you say? Oh, come now. No need to be shy. Hee-hee.
sc107_spa_1	Tres bien! This is truly paradise...
sc107_spa_2	<color=ff1493>Godfather! Am I allowed in your heart now? <color=ff1493>Ah, how truly splendid. <color=ff1493>It's been a long time coming. <color=ff1493>I forgive all transgressions!
sc107_spa_3	<color=ff1493>Wherefore is my symbol the sunflower? <color=ff1493>Because of its zealous adoration of the sun, of course. <color=ff1493>My heart's wish to shine brighter <color=ff1493>and stand taller than all else <color=ff1493>gave it this form. Hahaha!
sc107_spa_max	<color=ff1493>Time for the show to begin! <color=ff1493>The greatest comedy the world has ever known! <color=ff1493>And in the leading roles, of course, <color=ff1493>are myself and my Godfather! <color=ff1493>History has never seen a greater pair of heroes!
sc110_spa_1	What are you looking at?\Don't do anything weird. Get outta here!
sc110_spa_2	Ziva's cooking is the best in the whole world, you know.\Not that that's why I married her.
sc110_spa_3	I'm Ziva's only Child.\And she's my only master.
sc110_spa_4	It seems Ziva's taken a liking to you.\Call me up whenever you want.\I'll help you out.
sc110_spa_5	
sc110_spa_max	A peaceful Infernal Realm?\That's crazy talk.\Now I see why Ziva likes you.
sc112_spa_1	If you think I've opened up to you just because you brought me to a mere hot spring...you're gravely mistaken.
sc112_spa_2	The succubi were saying I should obey you. Why, then, are you so quiet? Do you really think it doesn't matter how I treat you?
sc112_spa_3	I hate demons. I truly do. Even so, I've no intention to oppose you. That much I promise you.
sc112_spa_max	Do not give up. Demon or not, if you seek truth, then the day will come that light shines upon you.
sc115_spa_1	Even time spent at a hot spring is meaningless...
sc115_spa_2	Oh? You feel like you get nightmares from listening to my songs? Don't worry—you can take solace in certainty. They DO give you nightmares.
sc115_spa_3	Demon. I thought you'd been enjoying my music, but this whole time, you've been wearing earplugs. *sigh* Very well. I'll take your tastes into consideration just this once.
sc115_spa_4	Performing for you brings me joy. It really does. How about I treat you to another funeral march?
sc115_spa_max	Since I played you some music, would you play me song I like in return? Excellent. Then I'd like to hear "Gloomy Sunday."
sc117_spa_1	I wonder if there's a spell to permanently stop my glasses from fogging up...
sc117_spa_2	You want to be friends, you say? What a perplexing thing to order of me.
sc117_spa_3	Demons are wellsprings of strength. And I mean that in the simplest of ways. I'm simply fascinated by the power demons possess.
sc117_spa_4	Maybe you're a little confused. I wasn't fooled into making a pact. I made it freely.
sc117_spa_max	You're neither a nuisance nor a warmonger. You're not even threatening. But there's just something about you that puts me at ease.
sc120_spa_1	I'm so happy...
sc120_spa_2	I met a wounded flower today. It was crying in pain, but no one was taking care of it. How come no one can hear flowers?
sc120_spa_3	I wish demons would get along instead of fighting each other. I know! You should make flowerbeds together. The Infernal Realm would be so much prettier.
sc120_spa_4	Hey, where are you? I could use some company. Being on my own is lonely. Hm? What do you mean I'm spoiled?
sc120_spa_max	Don't worry. I'll protect you! I'm a little scared, but I have to be brave. You need my help, don't you?
sc121_spa_1	C-Could you not stare too much?
sc121_spa_2	Listen well to the voice in your soul. I did, and emotions I had never known become as a song in my ears.
sc121_spa_3	Don't you have a song for me? Maybe it's better left unheard. Your voice, though... I sense the burden of expectation in your tone. Vexing indeed.
sc121_spa_4	I'll teach you music. No need to worry—I'm sure you'll understand. Assuming you can find inspiration in your soul, of course.
sc121_spa_max	Let me sing a song for you. This song will ignite your passion and draw out your courage.
sc122_spa_1	This is the life.\If I could collect places, this one would have long been\in my hoard.
sc122_spa_2	The thing on my head?\It is nice, isn't it?\I've made a habit of putting it up there.
sc122_spa_3	Is the time spent here in the hot springs\also of value?
sc122_spa_4	I'm thinking of building\a hot spring like this one on my island.\You'll come enjoy it when it's finished, right?
sc122_spa_5	Drop by the store sometime, will you?\I'll be waiting.
sc122_spa_max	I'll let you have the honor of opening up a chest\next time you come to the store.
sc123_spa_1	Meeeow. I'm in happy cat mode, meow.
sc123_spa_2	You're so relaxed. You must have already finished your proposal. Well? Let's see it. Surely it's impeccable.
sc123_spa_3	I can't believe you're a demon and you still choose to rent out such a run-down apartment. Let me talk to my grandpa and get you a house built in the swankiest district by the big river.
sc123_spa_max	I haven't heard a single word of thanks from you. It's not that I crave your validation; I just want you to acknowledge my efforts!
sc124_spa_1	It feels like my body is burning up...\I don't really care for heat...
sc124_spa_2	Still alive, are you? ...Oh, he ran away. I feel like there's been a misunderstanding.
sc124_spa_3	When I became an Archfiend candidate, I heard a phrase that stuck with me: "Don't carry your own baggage." It still resonates. That said, I think I can handle it if it's just you.
sc124_spa_4	It's so strange. Despite how uncooperative I am, you keep lingering around me. You're not gaining anything from that, you know. You want my advice? Stop wasting your time.
sc124_spa_5	I had no intention of getting all buddy-buddy with you. You can't imagine how little I care. But demons don't act like you think they will. Look—I just changed my mind.
sc124_spa_max	You're still growing stronger. But that and enduring hardship are two different things. The stronger you are, the more you'll struggle. When that time comes, I'll lend you my aid.
sc125_spa_1	The weather today is positively perfect\for a dip in the hot springs.
sc125_spa_2	When I stop to think of what I'd do\if I confessed my feelings for Rusalka,\I get so scared I end up saying nothing.
sc125_spa_3	I-I-I!\A-A-Am!\A knight who will protect...\This isn't gonna work like this, is it?
sc125_spa_4	My love for Rusalka gives me strength.\That's why I can't give up.
sc125_spa_5	I don't care if I'm rejected.\I must let her know how I feel.
sc125_spa_max	Master,\there's nothing to fear.\You need not hide your true feelings.
sc126_spa_1	I look like I'm enjoying myself? Heh, how could you tell?
sc126_spa_2	Not to worry, Master. I'll help you discover the love you didn't know you had within.
sc126_spa_3	I want you to disavow the idea that demons and love don't mix. Ah, I can see it now—our dear master, hopelessly in love! Hee hee.
sc126_spa_max	Aren't you lonely, Master? I can tell if you're lying. I know you were born to be loved. Now, accept this love! Lovely Sunshine Impact ♥
sc127_spa_1	Now, where should I hide next?
sc127_spa_2	A fool believes only in his own strength, but there is wisdom in remaining hidden. Naught is sharper than a concealed blade.
sc127_spa_3	You're still terrible at this. I can sense your presence from a mile away.
sc127_spa_4	Staying out of the frat and having your Childs fight instead is a strategy I can get behind. ALL the way behind. Like, away from the action.
sc127_spa_5	Everyone around me is my enemy. Although... Having one friend I could trust might not be so bad. Someone like you, for example.
sc127_spa_max	I'm only helping you because I'm a Child. You shouldn't put too much trust in me. Then again, I WAS pretty good, eh? It's because I'm so patient.
sc130_spa_1	That's it... I can feel inspiration coming to me...
sc130_spa_2	Haven't you ever heard that a genius is one who works off of 100% inspiration? Who said that, you ask? Me, of course!
sc130_spa_3	I don't need acclaim. So long as I'm personally satisfied, that's enough for me. But if I had to pick one other thing I'd like... It'd be Master's praise.
sc130_spa_max	Silence! A breathtaking musical composition is coming to me! What kind of song, you ask? One for you, of cour— Ack! That was meant to be a secret!
sc132_spa_1	Live it up!
sc132_spa_2	I'm trying to think, so could you quiet down?
sc132_spa_3	Demons are creatures who indulge in pleasure—who revel in overabundance. And then there's you, leading an honest, frugal life.
sc132_spa_4	Death awaits us all. You can only enjoy life while you have it.
sc132_spa_5	Live every day as if it was your last. That way, you won't have any regrets.
sc132_spa_max	I don't think you have to work so hard. Sure, you might not be as powerful as the other Archfiend candidates, but there are certain abilities and a charisma that only you have.
sc133_spa_1	Teehee, this is kind of embarrassing.
sc133_spa_2	How about a little challenge? If you survive the Archfiend Contest, you win. If you die, I win!
sc133_spa_3	Oh, come on, it was just a little joke. Don't get so upset. That sour expression just makes me want to mess with you even more!
sc133_spa_4	Messing with you is what I do for fun. Aw, are you upset again? Hee hee.
sc133_spa_max	You look so cute when you're sleeping. It makes me want to play a prank on you. But it'd be a waste to wake that pretty face, so I'll content myself with watching you instead.
sc135_spa_1	Who said you could look?
sc135_spa_2	My only wish is to protect what is precious to me. The only problem—if you can call it that—is that I'm still trying to find it.
sc135_spa_3	You're so kind, little imp. But you can trust me. After all, a true warrior would never betray her master.
sc135_spa_max	My place is before you, and yours behind me.
sc139_spa_1	I had a dream. In it, there were butterflies flying amidst blooming flowers... And I was there, the same as ever.
sc139_spa_2	This isn't the place I've been looking for—the one etched into my memories. Then again, I think it's grown on me.
sc139_spa_3	Once the Archfiend Contest ends, we'll be leaving this place, won't we? We've already made some nice memories here. Having to leave in search of new horizons certainly won't be easy.
sc139_spa_4	I don't think I'm the Child you wanted. I'm really not comfortable encountering new places and people. I need you to tell me what to do.
sc139_spa_max	You were the first to tell me I could live without responsibilities. I'll never forget how that soothed my anxious heart. I've decided I'm going to pay you back for that someday.
sc141_spa_1	Mmm, it's so warm. Feels incredible.
sc141_spa_2	I sent a love letter! Look! It's addressed to you. I wrote your name in red here, see? It represents the passionate feelings I have for you, Master.
sc141_spa_3	Love doesn't always bring you joy. Sometimes it's accompanied by pain. But I don't care. I'm going to keep loving until I die!
sc141_spa_4	A-ha! I was wondering why you're always on your own, but now I know it's because you're so shy about being loved! You're so cute, Master ♥
sc141_spa_max	What's a demon, exactly? Master has the right to love, just like the humans he looks up to so mu— Oops, I should've kept that to myself.
sc142_spa_1	Am...am I dreaming? Or is this reality?
sc142_spa_2	Hello, Demon. What's up? You look so cheerful. Did you have nice dreams or something? Mine were nightmares.
sc142_spa_3	Do you want to live in a world of dreams with me? It's never cold there, and people are always smiling. It'd be an even happier world if you came with me.
sc142_spa_max	I had a dream that reality was melting away. Everything in the dream disappeared, but it's okay, because you'll be in my dreams forever.
sc147_spa_1	What's with this tepid water?\Hurry and turn up the heat.
sc147_spa_2	Hey! Piss off. You're in the way. Ugh, I'm surrounded by idiots wherever I go.
sc147_spa_3	Hey, quit beatin' around the bush and say what you mean. Don't you think we'll finally be able to have a conversation if you do that?
sc147_spa_max	If you ask me, you're probably better off stayin' an idiot than tryin' to half-ass being a bad guy. I'm bad enough for both of us.
sc148_spa_1	Ahhh, that feels real good!
sc148_spa_2	A-ME-RI-CA-NO! Do your ears work? Go buy me an iced Americano!
sc148_spa_3	Being a supervillain comes naturally to me. I don't need your help.
sc148_spa_4	The other Childs always complain that I'm too riled up or causing trouble. What, is that supposed to bother me?
sc148_spa_max	You think I'm selfish? What, are you jealous that I don't give a crap what others think? You should try it sometime! If you can't figure it out, then watch me!
sc149_spa_1	I feel better now.
sc149_spa_2	Would you hear my story? It could take a while.
sc149_spa_3	Why did you choose me...? Is it because I'm fat? Or because I'm dumb and bad at talking? You're so mean.
sc149_spa_4	I wonder if it's going to rain. I can almost smell it in the air. That reminds me—cats hate water.
sc149_spa_5	Being in the water's the best. Nobody bothers me here. The only thing that would make it better is if he were here with me.
sc149_spa_max	You know, you're the most important person to me... The person I met the moment I was born.
sc153_spa_1	I guess the occasional hot spring trip isn't so bad either.
sc153_spa_2	There's a legend regarding this hot spring. So, without further ado, it's time for... "Sunken Ship Search in the Sweltering Springs"! Hee hee, I hope you're ready for the hunt of a lifetime!
sc153_spa_3	You want to hear about my adventures? Are you sure? You might pass out from how amazingly unbelievable they are! Okay, how about I start with the time I met the lord of the deep blue sea?
sc153_spa_4	Life's an adventure! The journey only ends once you find your hidden treasure. What kind of treasure are YOU looking for?
sc153_spa_5	Lots of people say they're going to go on an adventure, but the ones who actually do are few and far between. If you're really one of the few, will you embark on a journey with me?
sc153_spa_max	My dream is to make a name for myself as a great explorer. They'll call me "Great Adventurer Epona." Don't worry—I'll make sure the legends mention her trusty demon assistant.
sc154_spa_1	What are you looking at?\Is it so rare to see a Child taking a bath?
sc154_spa_2	To think, all I possess is this languid, rail-thin body... Pathetic.
sc154_spa_3	You have no need to advocate for yourself, Master. Whatever state you find yourself in, I will be faithful to you. I believe that is what I must do.
sc154_spa_4	You think me boastful? I am simply concerned for you. However, if I have made you uneasy in any way, I apologize.
sc154_spa_max	Master, you need not make any more decisions. I will be your eyes and ears. You need only follow my lead.
sc155_spa_1	Letting a star have a private life...\Not a bad concept, huh?
sc155_spa_2	Not everyone is born as talented as I. But maybe she can catch up\to me if she tries hard enough.
sc155_spa_3	Once a star, forever a star!
sc155_spa_4	I want to be remembered as a talented singer forever.\I want to sing songs that will transcend time.
sc155_spa_max	Make me the greatest star of all time.\I want to sing for everyone and make them happy.
sc156_spa_1	It's good to be alive...
sc156_spa_2	Describe your Infernal Realm to me, boy. Perhaps it may serve to motivate you in battle.
sc156_spa_3	I am your Child, you say? What a curious statement. I doubt you truly want to know which of us is the real "child."
sc156_spa_4	There is no such thing as "eternity." All things fade away, leaving only twisted recollections. That is why I seek eternal life.
sc156_spa_5	It would appear you are trying to avoid me. Do I scare you? Being avoided so makes me the slightest bit lonely.
sc156_spa_max	I am ever cloaked in darkness. Even so, that means I am always waiting at your side.
sc158_spa_1	I probably should get back to prowling for playboys,\but this hot spring is kinda doing it for me right now.
sc158_spa_2	Whoa! This place is loaded with hot studs! I love it here, Demon!
sc158_spa_3	I found a super-hot guy that's just my type. Maybe I'll invite him to the pool later. ...Wait a second. I think this guy might be a demon. That shouldn't be a problem, right?
sc158_spa_4	I have to thank you, Demon. Becoming your Child gave me the courage to find love. Now, if only I could snag myself a hot date!
sc158_spa_5	Demon! Nothing's gonna happen if you just stand there. Come with me—I'll show you how it's done!
sc158_spa_max	You've been so clueless ever since we met. Well, you leave me no choice. Love's not gonna happen if I just sit here patiently!
sc159_spa_1	Shut up. All is meaningless,\except for the words of Loki.
sc159_spa_2	Ooh, what is it?\I can tell you're scheming something. \I'm very busy.
sc159_spa_3	This is like "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage"\or "The North Wind and the Sun," isn't it?\You're being nice to me on purpose, I can tell.\Ho ho, you're cute. I don't dislike your approach. \Actually, you're finally behaving like a demon.
sc159_spa_4	My tiny little friend,\you're feeling me out again.\What is it you want from me? You're barking up the wrong tree, friend.\I've already dedicated my all to him. \You're late, little boy.
sc159_spa_5	You want me to act friendly toward you?\But that's not sincere. \There's no such thing as a friend who will complete your soul.\It's make-believe; a lie that always ends in tears. \Do you still want to be close to me? \... Oh, you're such a fool.
sc159_spa_max	Okay, you stubborn demon, we can be friends. \Every demon is unique\in its own way,\and you're unique because of your stubbornness. \You won. Happy now? Geez, how can you be so persistent? \I'm impressed.
sc164_spa_1	Wh-What do you\think you're doing?!
sc164_spa_2	What's with that face? Are you trying to figure out what's going through my head? You really shouldn't size people up like that.
sc164_spa_3	How annoying. Everyone thinks we had a fight. I just get a little uncomfortable being right beside you, that's all.
sc164_spa_4	I'd appreciate it if you'd consider my feelings from time to time. Even if I'm a little cold, please be patient with me.
sc164_spa_max	I know I told you to go away, but you don't have to go THAT far. You can get a little closer. ...Ah! Too close.
sc167_spa_1	I almost feel bad that I'm the only one enjoying myself this much.
sc167_spa_2	How do you do, Master? What shall we talk about today? We have plenty of time, so let's take it easy and shoot the breeze.
sc167_spa_3	How long can a demon live? Rather, how long can you and I be together? It's strange. I've been thinking only of the future for so long now.
sc167_spa_4	Childs and humans aren't so different, really. I might be good at being a Child. In fact, I have a pretty wicked disposition. Hee hee, I'm just joking.
sc167_spa_5	I know I'm spoiled, but sometimes I just feel like depending on you. After all, I am your Child, and you are my Master. ...Um, did I come on a little strong?
sc167_spa_max	Tell me everything. I want to know you better. What kind of demon are you when I'm not around?
sc169_spa_1	All of my chocolate melted... *sniff*
sc169_spa_2	Demons always seem kinda down in the dumps. If only they had some chocolate, I'm sure they'd feel better.
sc169_spa_3	*sigh* ...Why am I sighing? Well, I was just copying you, Master.
sc169_spa_max	I'm glad we can take it easy like this, Master. I'm gonna buy you some sweet chocolates when we get back. I'll spring for the special kind that tastes like sheer joy.
sc172_spa_1	Getting clean makes your heart feel lighter.
sc172_spa_2	Another letter from him today? Write a reply, you say? Maybe I should. Ah, what to do?
sc172_spa_3	Hello, boy. You came at just the right time. I was saying a prayer for you. Would you say a prayer for me, t— Hey, leaving so soon? Hee hee...
sc172_spa_4	Could you help me with something? Someone confessed their love to me. Like, for real. I thought maybe your encouragement could help me open up to them.
sc172_spa_max	How about turning to look back at me sometime? You'll see it in my eyes: a soft, beautiful light shining down on you.
sc173_spa_1	Getting in a hot spring is more fun than I thought it would be.
sc173_spa_2	Master, you get bored every day too, right? That's why you're always making that face.
sc173_spa_3	If you won't play with me, then go away. You're distracting me.
sc173_spa_4	You look bored, Master. Wanna play with me? Nobody asked me to, either—I decided on my own. No? Not feelin' it?
sc173_spa_5	I hate fighting. It's so annoying. And all the sweating? Ew. I'd much rather play house with you, Master.
sc173_spa_max	Look, I get it. Spending time with me is annoying. ...Huh? It's not? I dunno if you mean that or not, but just hearing you say it makes me kinda happy.
sc174_spa_1	Ahh, I didn't realize how worn out I was until just now...\I guess a little self-care really can go a long way.
sc174_spa_2	Just the two of us like this... I might be getting a little nervous. ★ Wait, this is perfect. Now broadcasting live: "A.I's Exclusive Hot-and-Heavy Special Report!"
sc174_spa_3	Hiii, little Candidate! What big scoops do you have for us today? Hee hee, I'm just pulling your leg! Anyway, you sure have a way of finding me.
sc174_spa_4	It's the little Candidate again! I'm enjoying some "me" time right now, but you're welcome to join me for a bit. Well? You wanted to talk, didn't you?
sc174_spa_5	The Archfiend Contest is heating up in more ways than one! The ratings are on fire! Man, I love the Archfiend Contest! I'm never going back to the days of reporting on no-name demons.
sc174_spa_max	Exclusive! An Intimate Date with Channel Evil Reporter A.I! ★ I'm thinking of broadcasting our date live for the fans. What do you say? Are you in?
sc175_spa_1	A true knight must remain ever vigilant, even at times like these.
sc175_spa_2	Master, it's been a while since the Archfiend Contest began. Would it be all right if I tested you to see how much you have grown?
sc175_spa_3	I worry whether we have the time to enjoy such luxuries as a hot spring while the Contest is underway.
sc175_spa_4	It's my duty as a Child to serve under you. I don't desire any compensation.
sc175_spa_5	I heard you were worrying about me. I assure you there is no such need. I, Red Cross, will be your invincible knight, and— Oh. It was Lady Una you were worried about.
sc175_spa_max	Be confident. I will remain at your side protecting you until the last. You focus on upholding and spreading your ideals.
sc176_spa_1	This is like the lap of luxury!\And it's all thanks to you.
sc176_spa_2	Here's a rare sight. Don't see you that often. Hello. What can I do for you today? What? Nothing? Well, that's a boring thing to say.
sc176_spa_3	Hee hee hee! I'm on a roll today. Lookit how much I made! That guy's an absolute unit, but he might as well have a block of ice for a head. Such an easy target.
sc176_spa_4	Oh, look, it's my latest target! Hee hee, I'm just messin' with ya. I'm not planning anything. You don't have to be so on edge.
sc176_spa_5	Hey, what are you gonna do when you become Archfiend? I think I'm gonna build a nice, quiet house somewhere far from demons and humans where I can remember my masters from time to time.
sc176_spa_max	Will you really be my last master? It hasn't really sunk in. Could my master-killing curse finally have lifted? I've lost enough people for a lifetime, to be honest.
sc178_spa_1	We're not going to play tag today?
sc178_spa_2	I don't know if this is right, but I'm just here floating like fog.
sc178_spa_3	If I disappeared... Would you remember me?
sc178_spa_max	Thank you...for understanding me. That's all I wanted to say.
sc180_spa_1	Marvelous! Simply marvelous! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
sc180_spa_2	The magnificent Lord Mammon desires only beautiful women and great riches! He needs nothing else!
sc180_spa_3	O, woe is this lonesome life! I would pour out all of my riches in exchange for her heart! Well, maybe not all of them. Perhaps half of half of my riches?
sc180_spa_4	How positively abhorrent. What a meager, squalid room—and what's worse, this clothing is rife with wrinkles. Servant number 1, use this money and procure yourself some proper attire.
sc180_spa_5	You shall act as a liaison between Ms. Mona and myself, Lord Mammon! Oh, yes! Haaahahaha!
sc180_spa_max	Now, servant number 1! Nay, carrier pigeon number 1! Go, relay my earnest love to Ms. Mona!
sc183_spa_1	Even a goddess needs to rest.
sc183_spa_2	Thou ask whether I have a recollection of my pactmaker? Thou art a fool, but I shall indulge thee. Human life is but foam—fleeting, and in an instant, gone. Thus did I leave behind all that I outgrew.
sc183_spa_3	Those Childs heal their maladies in this hot spring? Pitiable. Truly pitiable.
sc183_spa_4	Little demon, some trifling issue assails thy heart. Lay thy cares aside and come and rest beside me.
sc183_spa_5	Bend thy knee, lower thy head, and offer up prayer and praise to me! Joy to he who obeys my decree!
sc183_spa_max	I am ever at thy side. Bend thy knee before me and offer supplication. When thou seek aid, the blessing of the goddess shall be upon thee.
sc184_spa_1	As far as paradises go, this one's not bad.\Aaah, that feels good... ♪
sc184_spa_2	I wanna quit the Archfiend Contest and go somewhere faaar away! Might be time to plan my 1254th escape attempt.
sc184_spa_3	If the fighting ever stops and things actually become peaceful around here, I'm leaving on a journey to find paradise.
sc184_spa_4	Oh? Do you wanna run away together? Leave your succubus behind, maybe? I'm all about that. Yo ho ho! ♪
sc184_spa_max	Try thinking of paradise next time you're tired. There's no such place, you say? As if I don't know that! Paradise is something you make yourself.
sc186_spa_1	That made me feel amazing. I think someone deserves a treat.
sc186_spa_2	Can dogs even appreciate a good bath?\Don't you get in.\Go get me a nice, cold drink or something.
sc186_spa_3	Man, I should've brought Lovely.\Heh heh, are you jealous?
sc186_spa_4	Don't let the temperature drop.\You know what'll happen if you defy me, don't you?
sc186_spa_5	This collar is just for you.\You see, it's even more special than Lovely's.
sc186_spa_max	I think it's about time I acknowledged the fact\that you're the best master in the world.\After all, who else could tame me? Heh heh...
sc187_spa_1	Are my tears not now obscured?
sc187_spa_2	Medea, could you keep it down? You're going to make my head burst with all that noise.
sc187_spa_3	My heart has plunged into the depths of an ocean of sadness. It cannot escape, for I, myself, am the ocean depths themselves.
sc187_spa_4	Tell Medea that her warmth has comforted me.
sc187_spa_5	Just stay by my side in silence. That is enough.
sc187_spa_max	My past has been one of perpetual misfortune, but the time I spend with you from now on may bring happiness. I look forward to it.
sc188_spa_1	Wow... It's like my body is melting away...
sc188_spa_2	I finally have evidence! The culprit's as good as caught! And that culprit...is you, Demon!
sc188_spa_3	Hmph! You thought you could fool me with your obvious lies? Ha! Wait a second... Actually, you might be on to something.
sc188_spa_max	And for bad guys? The hammer of justice! That's right. My mission is to knock the evil right out of 'em!
sc189_spa_1	I wish you brought me to places like this all the time.
sc189_spa_2	Hey you, quit running away! You won't escape this time! ...Why am I chasing you, you ask? Your crime is not knowing why I'm chasing you!
sc189_spa_3	I don't care if you don't like it—deal with it! I wouldn't stick to you like this if you didn't try to escape every time!
sc189_spa_max	What am I gonna do when I capture you? I'll protect you from bullies! ...Uh, what's so funny?
sc190_spa_1	An actress's skin is as important as her acting.\Aaah, this should do wonders for it ♪
sc190_spa_2	There are paparazzi everywhere lately. It's a real bother. Actors' personal lives should be private.
sc190_spa_3	My most memorable role? It's gotta be the one where I played a company president who collapsed from high blood pressure.
sc190_spa_4	Master, you look like an idiot drooling in front of the TV. Oooh, I can't stand it! I'll be damned if I rate lower than a chicken dinner!
sc190_spa_max	Acting is neither falsehood nor reality. Instead, the actor is destined to see herself in the role. When I am acting, that is my reality.
sc191_spa_1	Mmm, that feels good!
sc191_spa_2	Wanna know where my strength comes from? Passion! Competition! Absolute confidence! A kid like you couldn't even dream of this kind of strength.
sc191_spa_3	I'll tell you my secret. The real source of my strength? It's my hair. Yeah, you cut my hair and I'm as weak as the next broad.\Ha! Did you really buy that?
sc191_spa_max	This is my duty! I'll be dead before I renege on a deal. You can count on me, kid.
sc193_spa_1	Eeek!\Stay away!\Come no closer, demon!
sc193_spa_2	This is pretty impressive for demons.\Who knew your kind could create a spa like this.\Ahhh...
sc193_spa_3	Who told you to start acting\all buddy-buddy with me?!\And quit laughing so loud!\If anyone saw us\they'd think we were friends!
sc193_spa_4	I think you got the wrong idea.\I only made a pact with you for Teacher's sake.\Stop ordering me around!\Although if it's a favor, that's another story.
sc193_spa_5	Teacher's sickness... It's in his heart.\I'm going to help him recover at all costs.\So, lend me a hand, won't you?
sc193_spa_max	You're a very strange demon, you know that?\Why do you act like a human?\You're not making it easy for me.\I might end up forgiving you.
sc194_spa_1	Shh... No uncouth remarks, agreed?
sc194_spa_2	It's not good to lie. Wait, that's not quite right. It's not good to get CAUGHT in a lie. Hee hee hee.
sc194_spa_3	Aren't demons supposed to confound and deceive? Master, we should revoke your demon card.
sc194_spa_4	Truth? Justice? Who cares? What matters is who wins. Hee hee hee.
sc194_spa_5	You're too kind, Master. And the kinder you get, the more you disappoint me.
sc194_spa_max	I'm looking forward to the day you become the Archfiend, Master. You'll be so easy to dethrone.
sc195_spa_1	It's so warm. Theron's enjoying himself too.
sc195_spa_2	You think Theron capable of catching people and eating them? How rude. Apologize to him this instant!
sc195_spa_3	Theron said he wants to go on a walk with you, and he won't take no for an answer. Are you okay with taking him for a while?
sc195_spa_4	Oh, look. Theron's staring at you with his tongue out. He must want to give you lots of sweet little kisses.
sc195_spa_max	Do you know where paradise is? Hee hee hee. You might say you don't, but I do. Paradise is wherever we're together.
sc196_spa_1	You want to try one of my apples? Don't say I didn't warn you...
sc196_spa_2	What am I doing, you ask? Something extremely important, I'll have you know: I'm existing. I'm doing plenty just by being.
sc196_spa_3	I am fully devoted to fighting on your behalf. You've readied proper compensation, have you not? Of course, there's nothing you could offer that would satisfy me.
sc196_spa_max	Those with power will use those without it. It is a matter of course. Yet that begs the question: what do we—who call each other "Master"—do in our unique situation?
sc198_spa_1	Good. This is how you should be taking care of me.\This way, I can focus on being your deadliest weapon...
sc198_spa_2	Hello. What's the matter? Hee hee. Are you expecting something? If you tell me the truth, I might just do you a favor...maybe.
sc198_spa_3	Oh my, how long have you been watching me? Hee hee. It's okay. I'm used to getting attention.\Weird, I'm usually much better at hiding how I feel.
sc198_spa_4	Caring for all your Childs and aides must get tiring, eh, Master? Hee hee, I'm kidding. Is being surprised by everything a hidden talent of yours? Heh, you won't rid yourself of me just yet.
sc198_spa_max	Alone with the opposite sex, and not a hint of tension. I'm sending out all these signals, and they all fly over your head. You let me down. ...Naw, I'm just kidding.
sc199_spa_1	So warm.
sc199_spa_2	My wish? It's supposed to be a secret, but... I'll sneak over to you and tell you later.
sc199_spa_3	I want to know what you're thinking, but you use a lot of difficult words.
sc199_spa_4	Mr. Demon. Mr. Deeemon. I know you're just pretending to be asleep. Get up and play with me already.
sc199_spa_5	Did you call me, Mr. Demon? I'm so happy you called me! You're my favorite!
sc199_spa_max	You're going to grow up some day, aren't you? I'm always going to be like this, so you better play with me even after you grow up.
sc200_spa_1	My glasses fogged up. This is why I don't usually go to hot springs...
sc200_spa_2	Every criminal leaves a trace, no matter how clever they are. Nothing gets past me.
sc200_spa_3	Have you seen any suspicious demons or Childs around here? Or perhaps any peculiar occurrences? Oh, don't worry. I'm just here as a precaution.
sc200_spa_max	Keep a watchful eye. This world is a melting pot of selfish desires and evil schemes. If you don't watch yourself, criminals will have you right where they want you.
sc202_spa_1	Yaaawn...\Now this is paradise...
sc202_spa_2	What am I seeking revenge for? Trying to get your grubby paws on my dark past now, boss? ...I'm just messin' with ya. Earn my trust a little more and maybe I'll tell you.
sc202_spa_3	I told you before, didn't I? You'll never know until you try. I haven't changed my mind.
sc202_spa_4	What do you wanna know? If I have a lover? Gahaha! Kidding! You're curious about my need for revenge, eh? Fine. My stupid, middle-aged old man was seduced by a demon, wrecked our home and ended up disabled. That's all.
sc202_spa_max	I was starting to think I had something on my face, but then it hit me that you're still curious about my past. Let it go, Boss. That's not for you to worry about.
sc203_spa_1	This place is so... mystical.\I like it.
sc203_spa_2	It doesn't matter who becomes Archfiend.\The weak will be mistreated all the same.
sc203_spa_3	I feel most sorry for the animals.\They can't even speak.\That's why I've vowed to protect them until the end.
sc203_spa_4	This is exactly the world I hoped for.\It's so peaceful.\The animals here look so happy.
sc203_spa_5	If everyone in the world\had as kind a heart as you,\coexisting with the animals wouldn't be such a farfetched dream.
sc203_spa_max	Thank you. You helped me change my mind\about demons. I'll be cheering for you\to become Archfiend.
sc205_spa_1	Check out that spray!
sc205_spa_2	Hey, Big Bro! Let's play a game! If I win, you have to bring me some of Theron's whiskers!
sc205_spa_3	Do you hate hanging out with me? It's just that you're always making that face. If you don't mind, how about we play a game today?
sc205_spa_4	Everything in my world was fake. It was fun, but also kinda uncomfortable and lonely. You called me into the real world, though, so I'm okay now!
sc205_spa_max	I'm gonna do my best to fight for you, Big Bro! I'm a super wizard, so I'll blast your enemies to smithereens! I've got your back!
sc208_spa_1	M-Mixed bathing?!\Wh-Where am I supposed to look...?!
sc208_spa_2	Pushing your body to the limit is a painful experience, but beyond that pain lies the true glory of a warrior.
sc208_spa_3	If you intend to call yourself my master, then you better be ready to fight and beat me! I'll bow to you only once you can do that.
sc208_spa_max	I wouldn't call you my master yet, but I do think of you as a fellow soldier. If we ever find ourselves sharing the battlefield, we'll be glorious brothers-in-arms!
sc209_spa_1	Wake me up if I fall asleep, okay?
sc209_spa_2	What is it now? Oh, I should be careful 'cause the water's hot? Whatever! How unnecessary, as if I couldn— Ack! Whoa, that's really hot!
sc209_spa_3	I'm so tired of butting in all the time. I should be able to leave well enough alone, right?
sc209_spa_max	Why are you so, so, so, sooo persistent?! How do you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results?! It's an exercise in futility.
sc210_spa_1	How dare you peep at the Archfiend's body! Off with your head!
sc210_spa_2	My story is no fairytale! It is historical fact within the Infernal Realm!
sc210_spa_3	Becoming Archfiend is a rather simple endeavor. One must be selfless and treat their people fairly, as well as remain true to one's ambitions.
sc210_spa_max	If you wish to become Archfiend, you must first learn to bow your head, as I have for you.
sc214_spa_1	Hmm... Not bad.
sc214_spa_2	Honestly, it boggles the mind that you call yourself "master" and yet cannot surpass even one of your Childs. It's nothing short of a miracle you've survived this long.
sc214_spa_3	There's no such thing as a beautiful victory. A true winner is a howling beast, baring its teeth and drenched in blood.
sc214_spa_4	For all the battles you've faced, I've seen neither development nor progress out of you. Am I to babysit for the rest of my days?
sc214_spa_5	I still do not understand your fascination with my briefcase. I thought you'd long given up on it. I'll show you its contents if you wish. But in exchange, I want you to put your life on the line.
sc214_spa_max	You always do everything halfway. I want you to find your resolve and apply yourself. If you do, then I, Jupiter, will aid you for the rest of my days.
sc216_spa_1	Awww, this is nice. Maybe I won't go home.
sc216_spa_2	You want us to be closer, my cute Kitty? Then you'll have to catch me first!
sc216_spa_3	Rules are made for breaking, no? Out of all the Child rules, obeying Master is one I'm more than ready to break!
sc216_spa_4	Whimsical folks with a strong sense of curiosity are my kinda people. That's not quite you, Kitty, but I think you make a great friend all the same.
sc216_spa_5	Why are you here? Oh, I know! You were worried I might run away again, right? Don't worry. I won't be leaving your side for a while.
sc216_spa_max	I'm probably gonna vanish on a whim one day. That's just how it is with me, you know? The light of the moon, the darkness... They call out to me.
sc218_spa_1	I'm so happy!\I wonder if my pactmaker has been to a place like this.
sc218_spa_2	Oh, oh! My skin looks translucent now!\This is better than any skin treatment.
sc218_spa_3	Master, come in.\It's so warm and relaxing in here.
sc218_spa_4	The water is so warm,\I feel as if I'm bathing in your love.
sc218_spa_5	Pleasant temperature, fluffy towels, luxurious steam.\I can enjoy this every day if I get married, can't I?
sc218_spa_max	Just the fact that I get to bathe here every day makes me\the happiest woman in the world!
sc219_spa_1	It's hot in here...
sc219_spa_2	Go away.\I can't stand anyone so indecisive and useless.
sc219_spa_3	You're hilarious.\You trust me without knowing a thing about me?\I don't trust you as far as I can throw you.
sc219_spa_4	The only reason I've acknowledged you as my master\is because it works for me.
sc219_spa_5	Are you that suspicious of a demonic lifestyle?\Drop the human act and be done with it.
sc219_spa_max	Become Archfiend and I'll bow down low for you.\As a useless master, you get only my most basic courtesy.
sc220_spa_1	Nothing beats a dip in the hot spring after a workout! Now, back to the grind!
sc220_spa_2	What a joke. The demon who's supposed to be my master is weaker than his own Childs. Hello, Mr. Pathetic! Are you listening?! Have you no shame?!
sc220_spa_3	Hard work won't let you down. Stay the course, and you're bound to win eventually. If you train that weak little body of yours, at the very least you'll become average!
sc220_spa_max	Mr. Pathetic, as master, you have to set an example for your Childs! Worry not! I'm willing to do all I can to help out.
sc221_spa_1	Enjoy anything and everything to its fullest.\That is the way of the warrior.
sc221_spa_2	Urgh, my head hurts.\Don't mind me. Just talking to myself.
sc221_spa_3	Ears are ringing again. This surely must be what it feels like to be despised by the world. ...Huh, it's out of character for me to say stuff like that. Forget I said anything.
sc221_spa_max	Black demon, to you I entrust my blade. Become the trusted sword of Rakshasa and carve a path into the future.
sc222_spa_1	I'm getting bored...
sc222_spa_2	I, El Dorado, am the sole Child capable of guiding a lowly worm of a candidate like you to victory. Now, sing my praises! Hahahaha!
sc222_spa_3	How shall I be remunerated for all of the aid I am giving you? ...You're penniless, you say?! Hmph! You could devote your life to me, but even a hundred of them wouldn't be enough!
sc222_spa_4	You believe me tight-fisted? Well, you are correct. What can you hope to protect with nothing to your name? Some demon you are.
sc222_spa_max	Demon, I am forced to admit that you are, if nothing else, determined. I deem you worthy to share in a fraction of my riches.
sc223_spa_1	A short rest before I depart on my journey.
sc223_spa_2	I am a wandering Child,\a witness to all things.\Demon,\you are the scene of our paths crossing.
sc223_spa_3	Don't fight the river's flow.\Surrender to it.
sc223_spa_4	Living is like a flowing river\and a stagnant lake.
sc223_spa_5	I finally see the river.\Let's enjoy our journey\until the day we part ways.
sc223_spa_max	I'm glad I met you.\I made such fun memories because of you.\Thank you.
sc225_spa_1	Uh, where's the women's bath?
sc225_spa_2	Can you do something about Davi?! She keeps trying to get me to pull her sleigh! Can't someone else do it?! Don't just leave me to do it on my own!
sc225_spa_3	Man, if only my master was Mona and not you. I'd feel way more confident swearing my allegiance and putting my life on the line.
sc225_spa_4	You want me to be a good Child and stay quiet? Done and done. In fact, next time we're fighting and you're getting your face kicked in, I'll stay reeeal quiet.
sc225_spa_max	Don't you have a girlfriend or something? Someone to cuddle up with during the holidays? ...No? Oh well. It's not like I do either.
sc227_spa_1	What? Even I take off my sunglasses off in the bath... Is it really worth gawking at?
sc227_spa_2	You were on the verge of capturing a Child and you let them go? Don't you DARE stop until you catch them next time. Are we clear? Now, get back out there!
sc227_spa_3	What does "justice" mean to you? Don't tell me you've never given it any thought. Actually, forget I even asked—the answer's written all over your face. Hmmm.
sc227_spa_4	You're asking what my weak point is? Ah, I see what's going on here. You wanna pull a fast one on me. Heh, how demonic of you to be so underhanded.
sc227_spa_5	Hey Boss, what drives you to become the Archfiend? Maybe justice DOES stir within you.
sc227_spa_max	Boss, if you can't believe in yourself, then believe in me instead. I'll protect you to the bitter end.
sc228_spa_1	Sometimes a cocktail is just as refreshing as tea.
sc228_spa_2	I think this is for madams only—\messieurs are not allowed in.
sc228_spa_3	Petit, you had a childhood, too, no?\A snotty kid with no worries, just like everyone else.
sc228_spa_4	A mother is a mother, even when she's far away.\I hope my pactmaker realizes that.
sc228_spa_5	Did you clean your room? Did you go to work on time?\Did you eat?\Dear me, when did you last wash your clothes?
sc228_spa_max	If you have a burden on your mind, you come to me.\I can't make it go away,\but I can give your mind some peace.
sc229_spa_1	Th-This is for women only!\Didn't anyone tell you?!
sc229_spa_2	There's no such thing as unnecessary information. You can't overestimate its potential as a weapon, either.
sc229_spa_3	I have all your information secured. That said, I doubt it would sell for much.
sc229_spa_4	I am not a cat! I'm a chinchilla! I've never been more insulted in my life!
sc229_spa_5	Hay! ...No, I'm not greeting you, that's my staple food! But I do love a good brownie from time to time.
sc229_spa_max	I do hard, honest work! You can't expect me to do it for free!
sc230_spa_1	I'll take you on anytime, no matter the place!
sc230_spa_2	Do not take your eyes off of the darkness within, lest it one day grow into a great beast that swallows you whole.
sc230_spa_3	Do not yield to your fate, demon! A flickering light is waiting for you beyond the edge of darkness!
sc230_spa_max	The future belongs to no one. We, ourselves, are the future! Come, you who share this cursed immortality! Let us embark on a journey! A cursed journey!
sc231_spa_1	Aren't you staring at me a little too hard?
sc231_spa_2	Don't you speak to me that way!\I'd make an excellent mother.
sc231_spa_3	I picked you as my husband since you're\a master... But perhaps I should look for another demon instead?
sc231_spa_4	Mr. Demon, have you forgotten the fact\that you are to be my husband?
sc231_spa_5	Seriously, what do I have to do to make\you fall for me?! Honestly...
sc231_spa_max	You shall be an Archfiend to be my husband.\So, just become an Archfiend no matter what.
sc232_spa_1	Hot springs feel so good.\You know, Mr. Devil, I think I...
sc232_spa_2	Was it my destiny to become your Child, or did I do it of my own volition?
sc232_spa_3	Are you craving some ice-cold lemonade, too? Hee hee hee. We're of the same mind. ★
sc232_spa_4	You have such a lovely voice, my talkative demon. Would you sing a song for me? ♪
sc232_spa_max	Sometimes I worry this is a dream—that I'll wake up and it'll all be gone. Even if that were to happen, I promise I would never, ever forget you.
sc233_spa_1	Hehe... Behave yourself.
sc233_spa_2	Good morning, Master.\Huh? Is it nighttime already?
sc233_spa_3	Do you know how long I've been waiting for you? See, my electricity's been kinda wonky lately, and I think I might shock— Ack! Master, look out!
sc233_spa_4	I really do like you, Master. Sorry I fried your computer. Tee-hee. Little slip up on my part. Sorry ♥
sc233_spa_max	You're really scary when you get mad, but I know you're just worried about me. Oops, did I shock you again?
sc234_spa_1	I feel as if the fires that lay dormant in my heart are once again roaring to life.
sc234_spa_2	I choose how I use my strength! My actions, my choices—they're mine to make!
sc234_spa_3	I follow my path! You follow yours!
sc234_spa_4	Do you need my strength? Convince me. Prove to me the labors you have for me are worth doing!
sc234_spa_max	I sympathize with your indolent impulses. There is a part of me like that.
sc235_spa_1	Did you see?\Did you? You better not have.
sc235_spa_2	*sigh* Nothin' but small fry. Who? Oh, just the handful of wrongdoers I brought to task today.
sc235_spa_3	Who are you calling "kind"? Me? I just can't sit back and say nothing when someone gets on my nerves, that's all.
sc235_spa_4	Are the others treating you like a pushover because you're weak? Next time you're getting bullied, you come straight to me, okay?
sc235_spa_max	Oh, you're here already? Think you can pull your own weight today? You have to stop depending on others and fight your own battles.
sc237_spa_1	Mm, I love this!\Hee hee ♪
sc237_spa_2	Medb makes a fool of me literally every day.\Granted,\she does apologize after the fact. Heh.
sc237_spa_3	I gave up the Archfiend Contest with some tricks.\Medb and Ailill helped me.\I heard there were a few demons like me.\I was relieved, you know. How can one so stupid as I am can be a candidate?
sc237_spa_4	Thanks for all the fun today.\Let me know if you ever need\my help. You know\I wouldn't drag you down.
sc237_spa_5	Halloween was so much fun.\I wish it could be Halloween every day instead of just once a year.\You wouldn't understand, though.\Your life is a blast!
sc237_spa_max	I'm still an amateur,\but I'll take photos of you like a pro soon.\I'm not giving up my one and only hobby.\So... don't go back to the Infernal Realm\before I do, eh?
sc238_spa_1	Ow ow ow, my back and feet are killing me... Come on, then! Less gawking, more massaging!
sc238_spa_2	Oh, geez, what are you snoopin' around for? I can tell you want to know something. You're so easy to read!
sc238_spa_3	Ailill and Typhon? Zero ambition, the both of them! Why couldn't they join the Archfiend Contest? It would've been so fun if one of them had won.
sc238_spa_4	I honestly can't tell if you've improved at all. Your aides are the only reason you're still in one piece, you know. I've seen my fair share of demons, but you're the weakest by far.
sc238_spa_5	The Mortal Realm is more fun than I gave it credit for. You don't have to be on your toes all the time like in the Infernal Realm. That's why you like it so much here, no? Makes sense.
sc238_spa_max	Seriously, what would you do without me? I'd be so embarrassed if I heard some random demon took out my cute little protégé. Stay close, you hear?
sc239_spa_1	What's this... magical flavor?!
sc239_spa_2	That Grendel really grinds my gears.\Is she ready to fight with me for real?
sc239_spa_3	Get on my nerves--even a bit--and I'll blow you sky high.\What was that? Did you flinch? Hahaha!
sc239_spa_4	Buddies? What's the point in having those?\It's nothing but trouble. But if you insist,\show me how it's done.
sc239_spa_5	If you don't like someone, blow 'em up.\What are you, scared? Should I do it for you?\Hahaha! Leave it to me!
sc239_spa_max	Did you keep making Childs 'cause you were lonely?\It's not my style, but I'll play along\with the whole friend thing with you.
sc242_spa_1	Hm-hmmm! There're so many interesting things in the Mortal Realm.
sc242_spa_2	Are there other cheer squads, you ask? Well, yeah, but they usually just cheer and that's it. We might be the only one that adds some practical jokes into the mix.
sc242_spa_3	What are you thinking, walkin' around like that? It's gross. Guys, I tell ya—you give 'em an inch, and they're ready to take several miles.\Hey, why the long face?
sc242_spa_4	Demon pranks are fun 'cause there's no ulterior motive! It's just mindlessly going all-out for a laugh! I can't help it. It's too much fun.
sc242_spa_5	I spent the first hundred years after meeting Typhon playing jokes on him. He was so cute and innocent. With you, I think I'm in for another...oh, 200 years of fun, easy.
sc242_spa_max	Our meeting was like an illusion, you say? As in, you feel like it just as easily could've never happened? But you don't know the future. Who's to say we never would've met some other way?
sc246_spa_1	Please don't stare at me...
sc246_spa_2	Hello! It's me, the Christmas present who's just for you: Krampus! ★ You weren't expecting that, were you?
sc246_spa_3	Why are you being so quiet? Are you embarrassed or something? ...Ooh, did I hit the nail on the head? Hahaha! How adorable. ★
sc246_spa_4	I'm only helping you for as long as I feel like it. ★ Don't hold my whimsical nature against me.
sc246_spa_5	You shouldn't believe everything you see. Of course, it's not good to blindly believe in what you DON'T see, either.
sc246_spa_max	I was a little shocked when my previous master abandoned me, but thanks to you, I was able to rise above it! Hm? You don't believe me, do you?
sc247_spa_1	What kind of hot spring is this? Nary a flower petal in sight...shameful.
sc247_spa_2	Is that the manner in which you welcome a queen? Nonchalance? An utter lack of gravitas? You are so desperately lacking.
sc247_spa_3	This crown is not some mere accessory for anyone to wear. Remember that before you try touching it next time.
sc247_spa_4	You dare address a queen as "tiny"?! Insolence! I won't stop until I've plucked every last hair from that impudent, insulting head of yours!
sc247_spa_5	To rule, one must be strong enough not to crumble under the weight of the crown. Are you capable of that?
sc247_spa_max	I sense a royal disposition within you. It simply has not bubbled towards the surface. You're quite a late bloomer, but mayhap one day, you might come close to my level.
sc250_spa_1	Stop messing around in the hot springs?\Loosen up!
sc250_spa_2	Did you know ghosts also come out at hot springs?\What?\Did you figure out I meant me?
sc250_spa_3	I get extra antsy trying to stay still.\I know, I know. I won't goof around.
sc250_spa_4	Aaah!\Peeping tom! Pervert!\Hehehe, just kidding.
sc250_spa_5	It feels absolutely amazing. You have to try it.\I swear I'm not trying to pull a fast one on you.
sc250_spa_max	Won't you play with me next time?\I bet we'd have a lot of fun together!
sc252_spa_1	Not everything you see is true.\Don't settle for momentary happiness.
sc252_spa_2	This place smells mysterious,\and that's probably what lures the lost sheep.
sc252_spa_3	I can't stand aside and let the world\be ravaged by an army of demons.
sc252_spa_4	I'll only enter Nirvana when I'm done eradicating the demons\and bringing everything back in place.
sc252_spa_5	Our will is unstoppable.\We'll carry it through the endless circle of death and rebirth.
sc252_spa_max	Life is pain. But what can we do?\We'll just have to carry on with our karma on our backs.
sc253_spa_1	Nothing wrong with a warm Christmas.
sc253_spa_2	I've seen a lot of demons pretending to be little weaklings, but you're the first one I meet that actually IS tiny and weak.
sc253_spa_3	Is it true Christmas makes demons sick? That's a hell of a predisposition.
sc253_spa_4	I hate demons, what with their pride and their rudeness and their stench. Oh, that STENCH! It makes me wanna puke.
sc253_spa_5	I made a pact because of how much you nagged, but don't forget I'm an exorcist. *yawn* I just can't be bothered to get any work done.
sc253_spa_max	I find your aversion to work extremely relatable. After all, I'm just as lazy.
sc261_spa_1	In a place like this, I might forget the agony of blossoming.
sc261_spa_2	This eases the agony of blossoming.
sc261_spa_3	Is it alright for me to enjoy such luxuries?
sc261_spa_4	I'm looking forward to the day we meet again.
sc261_spa_5	To think we would chance to meet like this.
sc261_spa_max	Master, I will serve you with all my heart.
sc262_spa_1	Did you want something? Could you wait a little while longer? This feels too good to interrupt.
sc262_spa_2	Master, you said you're not afraid of anything. But if you ask me, I'm pretty sure you're scared of Davi.
sc262_spa_3	Your honor and mine are one and the same. Please don't do anything to tarnish it.
sc262_spa_4	Poor Master. Someone's been bullying you again, haven't they? Show me who it was. I'll yell at them!
sc262_spa_5	Your cowardice comes from your kindness. That's why I like you.
sc262_spa_max	I sense a strong determination within you. I'll watch over you until the end.
sc266_spa_1	Is this all right? Ah, well...
sc266_spa_2	How many years has it been since I last enjoyed a hot bath? It was so long ago that the memory is hazy. Huh. And now? Now all I can think about is the queen.
sc266_spa_3	I haven't been able to relax like this for a while. There were exorcists everywhere when I was in my prime. Hard times. I couldn't lower my guard for a second back then.
sc266_spa_4	Every time the queen gets more powerful, so does this headache. Her memories are coming back, too. What'll I do if she suddenly says she's serious about the Archfiend Contest? Haha...
sc266_spa_5	I've lived a ridiculously long time. Hm? I'm serious. I never got a break during my heyday. It was exhausting. I get to hang out with you now, though, and that doesn't get old.
sc266_spa_max	I've been around for a long, long while. Until now, I was always on edge, surrounded by some seriously evil characters. But with a demon like you around? I can actually have some fun.
sc267_spa_1	My, what a homely bath this is. I suppose I can debase myself by using it just this once.
sc267_spa_2	I was no goddess, but calling my past self a "demon" sits ill with me. What am I now, then? Pharaoh? A fallen queen? Or am I instead an Archfiend candidate? I am not yet certain. Perhaps this is a chance to start anew.
sc267_spa_3	Damn that Horus. I am most certain he is up to something, but just what, I cannot say. Or is it that I already know, but I feel compelled to feign ignorance?
sc267_spa_4	You speak to me with such nonchalance, but you are aware that I intend to turn on you eventually, yes? Have you no fear? Or do you still wish to speak in spite of it?
sc267_spa_5	I once reigned as Pharaoh, believing a ruler was meant to oppress. But as I watch you in action here, I realize perhaps there was another way. Even so, I shall carry on as I have.
sc267_spa_max	What is your plan? We may fight together in the Archfiend Contest for now, but only one of us can take the throne at its conclusion. ...Bah, pay me no heed. My mind simply races when I look at you.
sc274_spa_1	What kinda game is this?
sc274_spa_2	Guess what? The other day, my master actually called for me! It was no "here, kitty kitty," but I'll take what I can get! I wish you coulda seen it!
sc274_spa_3	I waited fur-ever for my master to wake up from her slumber. It feels so great to be out and about meow ♪ And it's all thanks to you, kitty cat!
sc274_spa_4	I had a dream of long, long ago. Of when I was curled up on our Pharaoh's lap. But un-fur-tunately, now that I'm a real big cat like this, I think those days are long behind me...
sc274_spa_max	Round and round and round! ♪ You ever chase your tail when you're in a good mood, kitty cat? Of course you do! ...Oh, I almost fur-got! I'm thinking of bringing you along for the ride next time my master calls for me!
sc275_spa_1	Boo! No peeping.\Don't be a creep, Master!
sc275_spa_2	You're bad when others think you're bad.\Doesn't that seem wrong? You shouldn't feel bad for doing what you want to do.
sc275_spa_3	Oh, what did I do wrong\that has made you so angry?
sc275_spa_4	Come on, I'm sorry I've put you through so much.\I promise I'll be a better person. A better Child.
sc275_spa_5	I am fed up with this. Why do you hafta look so gloomy?\Just do whatever you want!
sc275_spa_max	I don't like you being angry at me either. That's why I've been thinking...\Should I change me or you?
sc277_spa_1	Could you please not bother me while I'm trying to enjoy my time off?
sc277_spa_2	Life in the real world is hell, you know. And it only gets worse the deeper you go.
sc277_spa_3	There's one rule I stick by: It's all about the bling. And no, I'm not talking about jewelry. I'm talking about nothing but cold, hard cash!
sc277_spa_max	You and I aren't so different. We both got the short end of the stick. The one who really runs things around here is Mona, after all.
sc278_spa_1	Kindness is always accompanied by an agenda.\What's yours?
sc278_spa_2	To Loki, this world is a basket full of colorful candies.\They're all shaped differently, but have the same flavor.\That's why he's tired of them so easily.
sc278_spa_3	Wherever I go, I can hear Loki's voice.\Covering my ears doesn't help.
sc278_spa_4	If you're smart,\you'll stop fighting Loki.\I'm telling you this for your own good.
sc278_spa_5	I don't want to do anything.\I just want to sleep... forever...\Maybe this is because of you.
sc278_spa_max	Both you and I\have come too far.\We're just like each other.
sc279_spa_1	What a wonderful spot!\You're being so kind to me.\You must love me.
sc279_spa_2	Loki is still quite young, so he needs love.
sc279_spa_3	I can do nothing but love Loki.\After all, he's the reason I exist.
sc279_spa_4	Everyone around you is so rambunctious.\They all seem to love you\in their own way.\My dear Loki, by comparison, well...
sc279_spa_5	My wish is to die the day after Loki does.\But I also don't want to be lonely, so do you think we could die\on the same day, at the same time?
sc279_spa_max	You're young and frail like Loki.\Don't concern yourself, however.\I'll love you till death.
sc280_spa_1	No peeking, little demon.
sc280_spa_2	Lemme introduce you to my friend! This is my one and only real friend, Corn! Corn here's a real symbol of happiness, so be nice!
sc280_spa_3	Are all demons this dumb? You keep complaining about how much of a pain the Archfiend Contest is, yet here you are, still competing in it. Why not just ditch the whole thing?
sc280_spa_max	Good fortune only comes to those who work for it! But I kinda like you and all, so... Despite your lazy ways, I've been rooting for you!
sc281_spa_1	How did you know I'd be here? You really do defy my expectations in surprising ways.
sc281_spa_2	A place with moonless nights. A place where nothing but the eternal light shines down on me. That is what true paradise is.
sc281_spa_3	Fancy running into you in a place like this... We really are inseparable, aren't we?
sc281_spa_4	My eternal light will find no regret in forging a pact with a demon. No need to worry.
sc281_spa_5	Even if I can't fight by your side... No matter what, my master is—and forever will be— the most important person in my life.
sc281_spa_max	I hope I can return to your side soon, Master. I'm afraid if too much time passes before I do, you might forget all about me.
sc283_spa_1	Where could master have gone?
sc283_spa_2	This is a pleasantly tranquil place. The only thing that would make it better is if there wasn't an obnoxious demon here...
sc283_spa_3	I'm a maid: a servant to Sir Verdelet. And a maid serves only one master 'til the day she dies.
sc283_spa_4	I want to get my feelings across to the boss, but how should I go about doing so...?
sc283_spa_5	Do you have someone you cherish, Master? Someone you love so dearly, you would give your life for them...?
sc283_spa_max	I am forever my boss's maid. But don't you worry—I will still help you to the very best of my abilities. Such is the duty of any good maid.
sc285_spa_1	Hahahaha! Why are you so tense?
sc285_spa_2	I'm glad I was knocked out of the Archfiend Contest early on!\Watching fights is way more fun than being in them!\Hahaha!
sc285_spa_3	Ugh, pathetic demons!\They always come back whining when they lose\because they are weak...
sc285_spa_4	Hey, little one, what do you think of me? Wha—?\Hahaha. What do you mean sexy?! That's not what I was asking.\I meant how I compare to A.I!
sc285_spa_5	Demons are easily consumed by boredom,\so I find ones like you fascinating.\You live a normal, average life\without ups and downs. I think that's your strong point.
sc285_spa_max	A demon should live the life their heart desires.\Even if you're not an Archfiend candidate,\there are plenty of ways to have fun in life.\But, I feel like it would be less fun without you.
sc286_spa_1	You are satisfied, then, I assume?
sc286_spa_2	Good grief, do I truly have to teach you everything from A to Z? You are honestly quite a headache, Master.
sc286_spa_3	A "wannabe" and the "weakest," hmm? You sure have a reputation. But if looked at from another angle, that only means you have been given an excellent opportunity to prove your true worth.
sc286_spa_4	Just do precisely as I say. I won't suffer any clumsy mistakes, so be sure to get it right.
sc286_spa_5	It would seem you place higher trust in Lisa than you do in me. Hmhmhm... Well, I won't object to that for now. You will come to know my true talent sooner or later.
sc286_spa_max	So be it. I will keep pace with you, Master—but do not even think of losing momentum.
sc287_spa_1	First, I finish up my intense practice session, then I enjoy a brief moment of rest. It's like I'm a real pro dancer, right? Pretty cool, huh?
sc287_spa_2	You really need to put in some more effort, especially if you aren't bringing and natural talent to the table. You know what I mean?
sc287_spa_3	Nothing ever gets done by people who go easy on themselves. Diligent practice is the only way for me. And rest assured, you're in for it, too.
sc287_spa_4	Who do I hold up as an example of what I wanna be like? No one, really. Hey! I know, though! You should aim to be like the future ME!
sc287_spa_5	I'm pretty glad I became one of your Childs, you know. I wasn't so sure at first, but... Turns out it's not all that bad.
sc287_spa_max	Try not to focus on the others. All you need to worry about is yourself. After all, when the time comes, it's only gonna be you up there on the stage.
sc289_spa_1	*sigh* If you're free, join me.
sc289_spa_2	Sir Rufus was hardly what you would call "skilled." I mean that in a different way than I would say about you. Luin still seems to have reservations, though.
sc289_spa_3	Regardless of Sir Rufus' orders, I had no desire to be hostile with you. Everyone knows that when you're caught in a fight where you can't tell friend from foe, the one with the most obvious intentions loses first.
sc289_spa_4	My past? Ha ha ha... Well, aren't you an inquisitive fella? I guess you could say I spent most of my life focused on battling against countless demons. Did that dampen the mood a bit?
sc289_spa_5	I've devoted my life and my sword to serving Sir Rufus. Is it truly wise for me to let my guard down quite this much? I can't claim to know what he's planning, but...
sc289_spa_max	I am more confident than anyone that Sir Rufus will take the throne, but I have taken an interest in you—much like Sir Rufus has himself. Promise me you will chase after him 'til the very end.
sc290_spa_1	I never imagined this would feel so wonderful. It's like some unexpected sort of trial! Mhmmm!
sc290_spa_2	My my, what's with the slack-jawed stare? Your eyes tell me you're expecting something. By all means, then... I'm happy to meet your expectations.
sc290_spa_3	Did you know when humans enter hot springs, it restricts the flow of blood to their heart, which drops their blood pressure and pulse, causing some of them to faint? Humans truly are such fragile beings, aren't they? Heh heh.
sc290_spa_4	This is barely even stimulating. Spare me your hot springs "near" the Infernal Realm—I want one heated by the very fires of purgatory itself. Wouldn't that be THE best place to soak up all the agony?
sc290_spa_5	Obsessing over agony is the deepest form of narcissism—it's fully giving into yourself. It's not something for people like you, with no business here, to come poking around and peering into.
sc290_spa_max	You didn't just come here to doggie paddle around, did you? You seem like you might understand what I have to— Oh? Now what exactly is that face for? Pffft... Quit it, that's just too adorable! Hah hah hah!
sc292_spa_1	*siiigh* ...Oh! I can't believe I...
sc292_spa_2	I can't even begin to fathom what Sir Rufus is— Oh no! What am I saying?!
sc292_spa_3	Hmm? Oh, it's you. *sigh* I thought I'd have some peace and quiet here, but it seems that is no longer the case.
sc292_spa_4	Phew... Back when I was caught up in all the conflict, I never even dreamed of being able to relax like this. Not that any of that matters now, though.
sc292_spa_5	I won't pretend to know what exactly you are after, but I feel fairly certain that I am not a good fit as an ally of yours. Wouldn't you agree? Why not spend your time focused on more important matters?
sc292_spa_max	You truly have no idea what it means to be a demon, do you? There is not much that separates a real demon from an imposter, aside from one thing: the lengths they are willing to go to obtain what they desire.
sc294_spa_1	Hehehe...\Is something the matter?\Did you think I was bathing in blood?
sc294_spa_2	The lodgings I ordinarily stay at have facilities much like this. Boys like yourself are barred from entry, however. Teehee... Were you expecting something more?
sc294_spa_3	Ahhh, a day of rest at last. Spending time here reminds me of my old home. Not that I have any desire to return...
sc294_spa_4	Hee hee. Trying to sidle up closer to me while playing innocent, are you? Pledge your eternal companionship to me here, and I promise you a life much more joyous. ...Oh! Running now, are we? How rude.
sc294_spa_5	Sister Theresa, Miss Mariko, Sister Enka... I vow to never forget any of you, no matter what! ...Oh! Hello. I was just thinking of you, you know.
sc294_spa_max	I have spent a long time pondering how to handle the situation with you and with all of my companions who sacrificed themselves for me. I intended to do it alone, but I was overjoyed when you reached out to me.
sc295_spa_1	Ngh... Um, is this hell...? Or maybe...heaven?
sc295_spa_2	My Lord, your pitiful servant is here... Oh, look how weary my shepherd's feet have grown... Deliver me a moment's respite...
sc295_spa_3	Hee hee. Hello there, you charming demon, you. Heh heh... May the blessing of God be upon you. You, the greatest demon in all the world... Heh...heh...
sc295_spa_4	Sister Sayoko... I-I had a vision—a dream in which I was chasing you. Hee hee hee... Father Babila... K-Keep your hands off of her...
sc295_spa_max	No matter the time or place, I swear... I will stand by your side and do all that I can. I swear upon my very soul... A vow that lasts even beyond death itself...
sc296_spa_1	Eee! ♥ I just imagined you taking a bath, little customer!
sc296_spa_2	Imagine seeing you here, little customer! Oh, I'm just overjoyed! ♥ What's this, though? You don't seem quite as happy to see me.
sc296_spa_3	If anyone gives you any trouble, I'll blast them to bits for you! I mean, who do they think they are? I'm the only one who gets to pick on you, little customer! ♥
sc296_spa_4	Feel free to tell me whatever is on your mind, little customer! ♥ Hildr here will do whatever she can for you. You just be sure to say thank you, you hear?
sc296_spa_5	My little customer, you seem plum bushed. You just come on over and rest by my side, then! Hee hee! ♥
sc296_spa_max	I will do my very best to make you happier then ever, my sweet little customer ♥ That is a maid's job, after all! ♥
sc299_spa_1	You still take a bath with your mother?\Outrageous!
sc299_spa_2	What a miserable, slovenly, incompetent... Who am I talking about, you ask? Come, now. Surely you're not that dense.
sc299_spa_3	Not up for a fight, are you? Could you at least go get your butt whooped by someone else for me, then? Ugh, I really don't know how I'm supposed to put up with you...
sc299_spa_4	You know, it's weird. The more I stick around, the less terrible you start to seem. Is this what growing attached to someone feels like?
sc299_spa_5	Haha! Jealous of Santa Claus's fame, are ya? Why don't you join me, then? You and I can pen a new chapter for the history books!
sc299_spa_max	I've never been a fan of hanging around in one place too long, but I'll stick around until you become Archfiend. Not by choice, for the record.
sc300_spa_1	Master...\This is my own private rest area.
sc300_spa_2	If the path you walk is littered with obstacles, just blast your way right through them all. The word "impossible" isn't even in my dictionary.
sc300_spa_3	I'm putting off all incoming requests for a while. Making you Archfiend takes top priority.
sc300_spa_4	You really should think more highly of me. You won't find a whole lot of other Childs quite as good as me, Master.
sc300_spa_max	I never second-guess the choices I make. And since I've taken you as my master, I'm going to make sure you become Archfiend. No matter what!
sc301_spa_1	Oh man! This is the BEST! Why didn't you tell me about this place sooner?!
sc301_spa_2	All you demons are the same. Isn't there even one of you a girl can trust?
sc301_spa_3	You talk like you know everything there is to know about me, but I don't believe one word of the demonic garbage that comes out of your mouth. Back off!
sc301_spa_4	Look, Boss, you're gonna have to pull it together for me here. How do ya expect me to work for a guy I can't even respect, huh?
sc301_spa_5	I'll tell ya, Boss... You're the least demonic demon I've ever met, and I don't know what to make of that!
sc301_spa_max	Listen, you talk about setting me free once this whole Archfiend Contest thing is over, but do you really mean it? 'Cause if you do, then count me in!
sc305_spa_1	*sigh* This feels so good.\Truly this is the blessing of god.
sc305_spa_2	Oh divine children, show Him reverence. You evil ones who shall be judged, kneel down before the almighty.
sc305_spa_3	I am servant to the Lord. I follow His every command.
sc305_spa_4	I draw no line between good and evil. I merely follow the road that He says I must.
sc305_spa_5	There is only one thing everlasting in this world. Brethren, throw away your worldly desires, and open your hearts to salvation. Amen.
sc305_spa_max	I am Rita: she who is born anew from your demonic baptism. I am but a servant ready to offer my innocent soul to the Lord.
sc308_spa_1	The water's mighty fine...
sc308_spa_2	Hahaha! Sure, it's gonna be tough! But you can't turn tail now. No matter what anyone tells you, you gotta stick it out to the end!
sc308_spa_3	Quit tryin' to tiptoe around people, brat! In a battle of demons, it's all about sticking to your bluff. No matter how much of a wuss you are, you can't let your opponents catch on.
sc308_spa_4	No demon who plays clean is worth his weight. Same with straightforward, pandering punks. What I want is a place where real bad apples can really let loose! And I'm not letting up until that's the sorta Infernal Realm I get!
sc308_spa_5	No matter how you have to debase yourself, you win as long as you're the last demon standing! Hahaha! You should feel proud that ya took down someone like me, kid!
sc308_spa_max	There's no fun in trying to tame the meek. I like my demons to be the real devilish sort. Go on, then—just try and run from your destiny! That'll only make dragging you back all the more fun.
sc310_spa_1	I'm on a trip to a spring that's hot! Wowzers! This water's so warm! ♪
sc310_spa_2	The lady next to me said the water felt "so good." Isn't she weird? The water just feels real hot!
sc310_spa_3	Mona said she'd buy me some banana milk when I get outta the hot spring. She said not to tell you, though. She said you're not a little kid, so you have to buy your own.
sc310_spa_4	Hey hey, when is the Archfiend Contest gonna be over? Wanna go on a field trip together when it is? Do they have springtime down in the Infernal Realm? I wanna go find out!
sc310_spa_5	The weather people said it's gonna rain tomorrow. You should play with me if it does! There're so many people with cool umbrellas and stuff. I bet it would be super fun if we hung out together.
sc310_spa_max	Today's a real special day. When this Contest is over and you're the new Archfiend, I'm gonna sing songs with you. That's how I'm gonna make lotsa friends! It'll be so much fun if we all play together!
sc311_spa_1	I see I can't let my guard down around you.
sc311_spa_2	Hrmph. The owner of these hot springs tells me there is a rule prohibiting combat here. What an unfortunate predicament. You should consider yourself lucky.
sc311_spa_3	Listen to them. Glib fools, all of them... Not a single worthy soul among them. Has peace dulled your senses, or are you no real demon at all? We're right in the middle of the Archfiend Contest, in case you've forgotten.
sc311_spa_4	My name...? I take it you mean the name I was born with. Well... The name meant for me was simply stolen from a certain someone to begin with. I harbor no lingering attachment to it.
sc311_spa_5	I am more than content to be born as a demon and to die as a demon. But you—do you not resent your fate? No... I suppose not.
sc311_spa_max	Is it just me, or do I run into you every time I come here? I won't pretend to know what's on your mind, but I do notice you here often. ...No, it's nothing. Pay me no mind.
sc312_spa_1	Teatime? Don't mind if I do.
sc312_spa_2	You don't get it, do you, Master? How beautiful knives can be... No, of course you don't.
sc312_spa_3	I could absolutely go for a nice, big strawberry shortcake—topped with extra cream—paired with an ultra-sweet, ice-cold strawberry shake.
sc312_spa_4	Let me teach you the finer, artistic aspects of knives, Master! Hee hee hee... Hey, where are you going? Aww, and here I was ready to give you a nice, personal lesson, too...
sc312_spa_5	A knife left in dust is a knife left to rust. That's why I need to keep fighting. I hope you don't think less of me for it.
sc312_spa_max	No matter the knife, a good whetting will make it nice and sharp. The same goes for you too, Master...
sc315_spa_1	Heh, bet you're feeling extra lucky to wind up with me, huh?
sc315_spa_2	Hah, how about a toast to my charming reflection on the water— Ngh?! Oh, it's you... I hope you're not here to bore me.
sc315_spa_3	I'm into almost anything I can do to turn a profit. Wodan's research project doesn't run cheap, see. I'm hoping I hit it big and can stop worrying soon.
sc315_spa_4	Ultimate beauty is just one of my fundamental values. Eternal beauty, though? Now that's just a pipe dream. It IS comforting to imagine sometimes, though.
sc315_spa_5	Demons have nothing if not time. Why don't you work out some more long-term goals? I can't even begin to count how many demons I've seen suffering from the clutches of eternal boredom.
sc315_spa_max	The Rebirth Project is for all demonkind. My interest in ultimate beauty is just one of the short-term goals of the project. Do you have any need of our work? I'd be more than happy to help.
sc316_spa_1	Hrm... I can't really make out the writing here...
sc316_spa_2	*sigh* This is really no time to be slacking, but Methuselah had to run off anyway, saying something about research-this and survey-that. What I need are results, and he never gets any!
sc316_spa_3	Hmmm... We sure do run into each other a lot, don't we? Hm? You think that should earn you a "friend discount"? Ahahaha! You know what? I think that's the craziest joke I've heard all year!
sc316_spa_4	Nothing's more important to demons than beauty. And I mean, WAY more important than you're probably imagining. I want to give every demon a chance to get obsessed with themselves.
sc316_spa_5	Sorry for always harping on you for being horribly unattractive. The Archfiend never taught me how to properly lie... Ahaha, I'm kidding! I think you're just adorable.
sc316_spa_max	What am I going to do if I can't get enough support before the Archfiend Contest is over? I know: Why don't you partner up with me? I'll make sure you don't regret it!
sc317_spa_1	I honestly don't understand. The way you conduct yourself is just...*sigh*
sc317_spa_2	Well, there's nothing I can really do. And Kubaba just ignores me whenever she's around. I need to think up something that will impress her, fast.
sc317_spa_3	Aren't the animals of the world just so cute? Tame them once, and they'll serve you 'til the day they die. No matter what sort of person their master is. That's what makes them so repulsive...and yet so adorable.
sc317_spa_4	The Archfiend Contest... Thanks to a certain someone, I'm still around as a candidate, but should Kubaba ever give the word...
sc317_spa_5	You seem unusually at ease. I'm a candidate in this Contest myself, but I definitely don't trust demons like you.
sc317_spa_max	Today was a lot of fun. I wouldn't have to say any of this if it weren't for you, but...I'm well aware of what I've done. And I don't hold a grudge against you, but I DO despise you.
sc318_spa_1	Ahhh... This is paradise...
sc318_spa_2	The living are not the only ones who inhabit this world. The dead are here with us, lingering somewhere.
sc318_spa_3	I care for both the living and the dead, but the latter are my special charge.
sc318_spa_4	This world is nearly endless. And somewhere—beyond where our eyes can see—we are being watched over from lands far, far away.
sc318_spa_5	I sense you don't quite believe what I say... But I have been given a mission to bring the living and the dead together. That is my role in this world.
sc318_spa_max	I have something important to share: beware of water this day, else you may find yourself swept up in the tides of misfortune.
sc319_spa_1	Ahhh... This is paradise...
sc319_spa_2	I'm so glad to meet you here, young Master. As usual, you look rather ghastly...
sc319_spa_3	I am ever grateful, young Master. I only hope the day should come when I can repay you for everything. If there is ever any way I can be of help to you, feel free to petition my aid.
sc319_spa_4	If there is something weighing on your mind, go ahead and tell me about it. It's best to share our burdens rather than let them fester.
sc319_spa_5	Young Master, please, come this way. There is much I wish to tell you.
sc319_spa_max	You have my faith, young Master. You are the one true hope for someone like me, who despaired in the Infernal Realm and cast myself out to its Mortal counterpart.
sc321_spa_1	Come on in. You can sit right here next to me.
sc321_spa_2	Why don't we have a nice, long chat? We can gaze into one another's eyes and open our hearts... Teehee, or is that too much for a shy little demon like you?
sc321_spa_3	I sure don't mind having some R&R every now and again. It makes me feel a little bad for you-know-who, though. I wonder what she's doing right this very moment...?
sc321_spa_4	I feel so relaxed when I'm with you. You never change. I bet that's why all the other Childs like you, too.
sc321_spa_5	I thought a lot more would change when I became a Child. Still, I'm glad that I got to meet you. Hee hee... Quite the life, wouldn't you say?
sc321_spa_max	This is not the end—it's just the beginning. You may look like you're slacking off, but I know you're working hard. I better make sure I'm making progress, too, so I don't get left behind!
sc324_spa_1	This place is so wonderful.
sc324_spa_2	My dream is to someday be the greatest aide in all the Infernal Realm! H-Hey! Don't laugh!
sc324_spa_3	You should feel ever so lucky to have me as your aide, Master!
sc324_spa_4	What do I want? Why, simply for you to be the next Archfiend, of course!
sc324_spa_5	Whenever I tell people about my dreams, everyone just laughs it away, calling it all impossible. But I'll show them! Dreaming big only makes it all the more fun when it all finally comes true, yes?
sc324_spa_max	The most important thing to me is you, of course, Master. Though I'm not sure you feel quite the same about me...
sc329_spa_1	Whoa! My heart was racing when I was playing hide-and-seek. But now, I'm all relaxed and cozy.
sc329_spa_2	Vroom! Vroom! I've heard imagining the race\or something can help you train when you can't actually train.
sc329_spa_3	Master, Davi will massage you every day for a week.\Can't you buy her a D1 machine, please?
sc329_spa_4	Zephyros said I should race\like a blind horse. Maybe I should close my eyes while I race next time. Teehee!
sc329_spa_max	Davi must be in love with racing...\She doesn't love it as much as she does Mona, though.
sc332_spa_1	Ahhh, this is true bliss!
sc332_spa_2	Yup yup! I'm a bona fide heretic, corrupted by extravagance and pleasure. The name's Ganesha! Everyone's really struggling to get by, aren't they? Even despite demons like yourself being around and all.
sc332_spa_3	My legs are so sore from playing tag with those exorcists all through the night. I'm hoping these hot springs can help ease the pain, so could you just pretend you never even saw me here? Wahaha!
sc332_spa_4	Need my help, huh? Well, listen to you! Have you already forgotten I'm an exorcist? I could just purify you right here and now, you know! Wahahaha! No, I'm just teasing!
sc332_spa_5	Ugh. Looks like some sneaky paparazzi caught shots of you and me hanging around together. You're gonna own up to this, right? Not that you could have stopped them, since the pictures were from before we really met!
sc332_spa_max	I became an exorcist and all, but it just seemed so pointless, so I started to focus on having fun. I'm making sure I actually LIVE my life, but now all the exorcists are out to get me! Can you believe it? 'Course you can!
sc333_spa_1	Hmm... Not bad. You don't believe me?\I'm not being sarcastic. I'm being genuine this time.
sc333_spa_2	Who do you think you are, telling me to do this and that?\You really need to know your place.
sc333_spa_3	Sigh, just where have you been? What?\I wasn't waiting... If that's all you've got to say, then go away.
sc333_spa_4	I thought not anybody can become the demon king.\Well, you can still give it a try, I guess. If you're lucky, it might work out.
sc333_spa_5	Hey, you. Why don't you convert and repent?\Then I will accept you. I'll become your friend!
sc333_spa_max	You should feel lucky that you met me. Now that we are on the same side,\your future is bright! Ahahaha~!
sc334_spa_1	I don't mind spending some time relaxing,\just not too much.
sc334_spa_2	As the saying goes, "make haste slowly."\But sometimes you need to just make haste, or you might regret it later.
sc334_spa_3	Would you prefer dreaming forever without knowing the truth\or being awake and miserable?
sc334_spa_4	I've helped you up to this point\and you still don't trust me. Now, I'm feeling spiteful.
sc334_spa_5	Hesitating when you reach a crossroads is a waste of time.\Just make a bold decision and stick with it.
sc334_spa_max	Whatever decision you make, I support it.\Have faith in me and move forward with your decision.
sc335_spa_1	A nice hot spring after working out is the best.
sc335_spa_2	I only eat things that taste good.\Having something that tastes bad\is a crime against your palate\and your body.
sc335_spa_3	Train hard, have something scrumptious,\and then recover in the hot springs.\That's what I call paradise.
sc335_spa_4	You wanna know why I train like hell?\Well, I've nothing better to do.\Also, my lifespan's especially short, even among demigods.
sc335_spa_5	I'm 22 now, so I've got about three years left.\My lifespan changes a little each time I reincarnate.\Why do you ask?
sc335_spa_max	It's no big deal. I'm used to dying quickly.\What, were you worried about me?\C'mere, let me get you a drink.
sc336_spa_1	Oh... I hear the call of slumber...
sc336_spa_2	Peace without sacrifice... Is it naive to even wish for such a thing?
sc336_spa_3	This whole Archfiend Contest is built on sacrificing human lives, right? Even though it has nothing to do with them...
sc336_spa_4	Ending this whole Contest is the only way to bring about peace, right? If that's the case, then I must...
sc336_spa_5	I've finally realized: you and I feel almost the same way. There's no need for any more suffering...
sc336_spa_max	I'd like to see the sort of Infernal Realm you'd create. I imagine it would be fair—and quiet, too.
sc337_spa_1	Mew meow!\A dip in the hot spring after lotsa running is the best!
sc337_spa_2	I sweat when I run and when I get in the hot spring,\but I love doing both. They feel great.
sc337_spa_3	The most important thing isn't getting first place.\If you have fun running, what more do you need?
sc337_spa_4	I want you to give me pat-pats\if I come in first next time.
sc337_spa_5	I'm gonnya work really hard!\I wannya be a kitty you can praise!
sc337_spa_max	Purrr.\That's how cats go when they're happy.
sc338_spa_1	Are you worrying over me? Well, I got through another day without any problems, so at least there's that.
sc338_spa_2	Master, back then, the only reason I found the courage I did was because you were there by my side. I am truly grateful.
sc338_spa_3	We've been through so much ever since the day we first met. I've grown a lot, and I think you might have too— Huh? My outfit? Ugh, no, that's not what I'm talking about...
sc338_spa_4	Iphis is a real odd demon. She's brutally honest, and puts herself in all sorts of situations that she knows will hurt her. But I guess...she's a lot like you in that sense.
sc338_spa_5	I realized that I've only come this far thanks to support from you and everyone else. The way we all came together seemed like chance, but maybe it was fate. You all are the reason I look forward to each coming day.
sc338_spa_max	You really are a strange demon. Why do you waste time talking to a kid like me? You don't need to worry about hurting my feelings. But the way you do is so...demonic. I've kind of grown to like it. Heh heh.
sc339_spa_1	Mona,\aren't you tired of dealing with that stupid demon already?\You should come and relax with me!\
sc339_spa_2	You tossed me aside because I was too weak, right?\No need to worry, though...\I'm all grown up now.
sc339_spa_3	Phew... I'm alive again...\Huh? What?\Did I say something wrong?
sc339_spa_4	I'd head to the Infernal Realm if it meant I could see Mona.
sc339_spa_5	What do I want?\Well...to see Mona.\So, I already got what I wanted.
sc339_spa_max	I thought if I just became more like Mona,\people would care for me...\But I was wrong.\People had loved me all along.
sc342_spa_1	*sigh* I'm so bored. Hey, pipsqueak.\Want to do something more fun?
sc342_spa_2	Would you keep it down, pipsqueak?\I told you not to open your mouth until spoken to.\You couldn't have forgotten, could you?
sc342_spa_3	Honestly, I didn't expect much from the Mortal Realm.\But once here, I enjoyed myself.\Just in a different way from the Infernal Realm. Eheheh.
sc342_spa_4	You don't get it, do you?\The kinder you are to demons,\the more unfortunate things occur.
sc342_spa_5	I see you also toil.\I'll teach you\an easier way to live.
sc342_spa_max	You'd be happy if you only did what I told you.\Won't you try closing your eyes and heeding my words?
sc343_spa_1	Do you think this place suits me, short stuff? Hah.
sc343_spa_2	You want to get to know me better? Then you'll need to learn a thing or two about my desires. Are you sure you'll understand, short stuff?
sc343_spa_3	Don't forget to listen to that voice inside your head. No one can fight against their instincts, you know.
sc343_spa_4	I'll take that look to mean you don't believe me. That's too bad. I was hoping to find out about your desires, short stuff.
sc343_spa_5	Don't get the wrong idea. You didn't choose me—I chose you.
sc343_spa_max	I'll get you to the Archfiend throne, whether you like it or not. Ahaha! My mind is made up.
sc344_spa_1	E-Each Child has their own way of relaxing. That's all! I'm not playing around!
sc344_spa_2	Hard work is not something you can see, or feel, or touch. Do you think it's weird to be so focused on something like that...? Hee hee.
sc344_spa_3	Nothing charges my batteries like a hot spring. There's nothing to fluster, hassle, or irritate me here. Feels nice to just relax like this, doesn't it?
sc344_spa_4	What was it like before I met Anemone and Tristan, you ask? Hrm... I don't really remember. Maybe they were such terrible memories that I've locked them away...
sc344_spa_5	Oh! This little fella here is named Puppy. ...Did you just snort at me? You did! And you made the same exact face Anemone makes when she's poking fun at me!
sc344_spa_max	Please don't forget about me. I've put in the effort, but I know that doesn't mean it's guaranteed to go well. Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in a world where hard work actually pays off?
sc345_spa_1	Mmm. Wanna bet who can stay in longest?
sc345_spa_2	What is UP with this?! Look here. Are you the one who scribbled in my schedule book like this? ...No? It was Tristan? Ugh.
sc345_spa_3	Ugh, I am SO DONE with this! When is this freaking Archfiend Contest gonna be over with? Even that demon right over there looks way stronger than you. You're gonna kill a girl with anxiety here...
sc345_spa_4	Did you get an earful from Mona again? You poor thing. C'mere, I'll make it all better for you. Come on now, don't be shy.
sc345_spa_5	If you're really a man, act like it. You need to be more considerate of all these Childs who stick by you even though there's an endless number of stronger demons around. Or am I wrong here?
sc345_spa_max	Ugh! Isolde is all yappy and annoying as always, and Tristan is the same ape he always is— What's so funny? You're quick to laugh, but you're next on my list, you know.
sc346_spa_1	I'm just gonna nap for a bit. Wake me later. Zzz...
sc346_spa_2	It's a real pain, y'know. Everyone keeps asking me about us and it's really getting annoying. What am I supposed to tell them? That it's a temporary guardianship...?
sc346_spa_3	Seems like Anemone still wants to do something, but we're never gonna get to if she doesn't fix those sticky fingers of hers. I guess her best bet is just to get buddy-buddy with you.
sc346_spa_4	Guh... I think I'm about to get axed. If you hold even a sliver of hope for me, you'd best drop the subject. Not that I expect much consideration from you, though.
sc346_spa_max	I don't think things are looking good for my re-entry into the Night World, so I was thinking I'd just ride this out at your place. Whaddaya say? I want your honest opinion as a teammate on this.
sc347_spa_1	I am the guardian who never slumbers. Yet you dare tell me to "rest"?
sc347_spa_2	Your Childs are not your property. They are simply other souls who walk the path of life with you together. Do not grow too attached to them, Demon.
sc347_spa_3	The world is beneath my heel. Your fate is but one thing under my dominion. I watch over this world, and as such, you would do best to come to the light. Listen, and I will lead your way.
sc347_spa_4	Your struggle brings me delight. You are a precious object to me.
sc347_spa_5	Offer up your prayers. Put your very soul before the altar. Do so, and I shall remember you 'til the end of days.
sc347_spa_max	You are mine, and I am yours. As I cherish you, so too should you invest your feelings in me. Do this, and all shall be yours.
sc348_spa_1	Hee hee! Seeing me has made this an ultra-special day for you, I bet!
sc348_spa_2	Oooh! That feels great! I think my body really needed this. Maybe I've been going at my lessons too hard.
sc348_spa_3	My Maestro? He has someone special of his own. Hee hee. Although I guess I have a lot of fun lately peeking in on them!
sc348_spa_4	You're not gonna get anything by being nice to me. I'm a pop star—the apple in everyone's eye! This Sweet Devi Princess isn't about to fall in love!
sc348_spa_5	It's tough trying to be the sort of star everyone wants. But I at least want to do better than Aria, so I gotta stay focused.
sc348_spa_max	Hey, should you really be buddying up to me with Aria around? She's gonna get jealous, you know. Not that I care. You're a fan of mine, then? Well, I'm a fan of all my fans! ♥
sc349_spa_1	Proper skin care is important.\Hehehe... It's kinda fun.
sc349_spa_2	Our Maestro is friendless and mild-mannered like you, so I hope you'll try and get along.
sc349_spa_3	You know, I think the two of us might turn out to be great friends. I mean, we both share a great hobby, don't we? Hee hee...
sc349_spa_4	I've heard the Archfiend Contest means you put your life on the line with every fight. What do your Childs do every day, then?
sc349_spa_5	You know, I'm way happier now than I ever was as a human. Do you know how long I used to just spend in bed? It's all thanks to you and our Maestro. I'm so happy you've shown me this whole new world.
sc349_spa_max	I never really felt alive before I met you and Aria, I think. And then when I heard the roar of the crowd... It might as well have been my own beating heart.
sc350_spa_1	I'm kinda scared of water, but...\I'm an adult now, so...!
sc350_spa_2	What's your dream, then? You're always so good about encouraging me and Aria, so I've been thinking I should probably try and help you achieve your dreams, too.
sc350_spa_3	Keep this between the two of us, but I saw someone who looked just like my master on TV. It was just for a brief second, though, so I didn't even have time to catch the name of the program.
sc350_spa_4	Hard work is everything to me—probably due to the influence of my previous self's old master. Heh. Going forward, I plan to try and learn as much as I can.
sc350_spa_5	Live, breathe, walk, and talk like a human... Pulling all that off isn't easy, but there's someone I've got to meet, so I'll do my best!
sc350_spa_max	Whenever I listen to a cheering crowd, it's hard to tell if my dreams have come true, or if all of this is just a dream instead. No...this is reality. This is a wish come true.
sc351_spa_1	Hahaha! This is a pretty fun side show!
sc351_spa_2	Oooh! I never knew there were places like this outside the Infernal Realm! The things I learn every day!
sc351_spa_3	You haven't seen Maestro around, have you? He's gone and run off again, that good-for-nothing jerk...
sc351_spa_4	I don't really have any reservations about being a pop star. Not anymore, at least. It's strange, though, right? I'm a demon, yet here I am, obsessing over my celebrity status!
sc351_spa_5	We can shoot the breeze like this now, but if we'd met under different circumstances, we'd probably have been enemies. Really makes you reflect on how strange fate can be, doesn't it?
sc351_spa_max	It's hard to motivate myself to get back after finding a place as nice as this. Right, so... Let's keep doing our best from here on out!
sc353_spa_1	Even a proud knight must at times seek respite.
sc353_spa_2	With all the responsibilities that lie on my shoulders, should I really be spending time relaxing here...?
sc353_spa_3	What do I desire? Nothing at all! Nothing but to serve and defend you! But...I would not be entirely against spending more time in these hot springs.
sc353_spa_4	Others may worry over your weak heart and juvenile behavior, but that just shows how kind you really are. That's why I have nothing but respect for you.
sc353_spa_5	Master, follow me. I will see that you take the throne. I have devoted my life to this cause.
sc353_spa_max	My strength of will arises from my belief in my destiny. I will forever serve you as your knight. Trust that I will always be at your side to defend you, Master.
sc354_spa_1	Oh, this is just pure BLISS! ♥ Maybe because I get to be here with you? Hee hee hee ♥
sc354_spa_2	*sigh* I work SO hard just so my darling will notice and say something nice... But I guess he never was the sort to pick up on that sort of thing.
sc354_spa_3	I'm so worried about you, my darling. How are you going to get anything done without me around, hm? Look at you trying to deny it ♥ You're positively adorable ♥
sc354_spa_4	Well, of course I love you to bits, darling. You're so adorable that I want to eat you right up!
sc354_spa_5	Don't let those eyes wander, now! ♥ If you do, I'll just want to tease you more! ♥
sc354_spa_max	What are you holding back for? I've been yours from the very start, darling! Where do you think you're running off to, anyway?
sc355_spa_1	There's nothing like a hot bath after a long day of work.
sc355_spa_2	Mei has grown quite tough. I suppose there's no need to worry about her anymore. That must be a relief, I imagine. She has you to thank for that. Oh-ho-ho...
sc355_spa_3	This new power of mine is strange. I can do things I was never capable of before. And the only reason any of this was possible is because I am your Child, and no one else's.
sc355_spa_4	It seems I appear as a mother to Mei. She's not entirely mistaken there—I am the future self she aspires to become, after all.
sc355_spa_5	You say I've undergone quite the change, Master, but so have you. Little by little, you have grown stronger since the day we met. And I am here still to support you.
sc355_spa_max	An eager hope has turned into all-new power. It is thanks to the faith both you and Mei have put in me that I have awoken to it. I ask only that you continue to believe in me. I will change as much as I must for you.
sc360_spa_1	This is truly the gospel of Maat!
sc360_spa_2	Who needs heaven when we have a simply divine place like this? ...Oh, did I say that out loud? Hmm. Well, I suppose that's that, then.
sc360_spa_3	No matter how often Jeanne d'Arc might pester me to offer prayers to God with her, I have already found enlightenment and reached a height she still only dreams of.
sc360_spa_4	Does the Archfiend Contest truly interest you so much? Even though you could live a life full of blessings simply by staying at my side?
sc360_spa_5	I do not stick with you because I'm particularly fond of you, you know. Rather, I do it simply because you are my master. That's not to say I dislike your easygoing disposition, though...
sc360_spa_max	I don't worry about good or evil. The divine truth lies far beyond both. Let's just relax and enjoy the rest of these lives we were blessed with, okay?
sc361_spa_1	Why can't you shut up? Do I have to wipe you out?
sc361_spa_2	Bathory always cried so loudly\that I couldn't stand her.
sc361_spa_3	Do you feel sorry for Bathory? Don't. In her weakness, she let others walk all over her.
sc361_spa_4	Why are you being so friendly?\Stop it or... I don't have to say any more, do I?
sc361_spa_5	Hey, want to hear an interesting story?\You don't? But it's really interesting.
sc361_spa_max	You'd better treat me well.\Who knows? I might make you Archfiend. Hah hah hah!
sc362_spa_1	Ahhh!\I-I-I'm sorry!\Weird. I thought it was reserved.\I'll get out now!
sc362_spa_2	Actually, I'd been panicking\since I came to the Mortal Realm,\so it's been a long while\since I got to relax like this.\It's so nice and warm.
sc362_spa_3	Hmm, Mistress Eve's condition today...\Oh, hello! Are you here for some relaxation?\I came to unwind after work.\I'm always put through the wringer.\My shoulders get super tense.
sc362_spa_4	I, um, always get depressed quickly.\I often get told that I'm too negative.\I've tried fixing it but I haven't had much success.
sc362_spa_5	Even when you have so many Childs,\you don't just pay attention to me, but to all of them.\I think you're actually pretty strong, Mr. Wannabe Demon.
sc362_spa_max	I never gave much thought to the future.\It's been on my mind a bit more lately, though.\Thinking of when the Archfiend Contest ends\—10, maybe 20 years later—\and it's made the future more exciting.
sc363_spa_1	This place is freakin' great.\I gotta tell Logan about this!
sc363_spa_2	I want to stay here for ever!\Right, maybe I should just steal the hot springs?
sc363_spa_3	Stop nagging me. I know stealing is bad.\Says the person who steals the souls of mortals...
sc363_spa_4	Everyone has a treasure of their own. That includes you. What could that be? I'm so curious. Tee hee~ Don't be afraid.
sc363_spa_5	You are too nice for a demon. Try being a little more honest with yourself. You have something you want, right?
sc363_spa_max	You know, I never pass up on something once I've set my eyes on it.\Demon, what do you desire? I'll bring it to you.
sc364_spa_1	Mmm, it's like my stress is melting away... Oops. My candy melted away too. Hee hee ♥
sc364_spa_2	What sort of candy do you like? I'm a big fan of a nice minty flavor, myself.
sc364_spa_3	I'm counting on you to make my pactmaker's wish come true. It's my wish too, after all...
sc364_spa_4	They say nothing in this world lasts forever. But love sure does, don't you think?
sc364_spa_5	I made a special sort of candy just for you. You're going to love it, I swear! Hee hee hee... ♥
sc364_spa_max	You know what love is, right? Don't try and pretend you don't. I know you do, because, well...I've already fallen this hard for you.
sc365_spa_1	Don't worry,\I'm waterproof.
sc365_spa_2	Don't worry—the temperature I reach when I overheat is far higher than these waters. Hm? That's not what you're worried about? What seems to be the issue, then?
sc365_spa_3	I came here in search of new inspiration. I've heard that the right amount of water pressure can cut through a diamond, so I thought I could make use of facilities here.
sc365_spa_4	Time for maintenance, is it? I truly wish I did not have to leave these waters. If I had known better, I would have come after maintenance instead.
sc365_spa_5	I've learned that sometimes even I can make mistakes. No one born with emotion is ever perfect. I only hope that you will help guide me if I ever seem to be wandering astray.
sc365_spa_max	Now that you've brought me here to this hot spring, I can now handle more intricate adjustments. Feel free to consider me ready for battle. Keep in mind that I will still need your help. Heh.
sc366_spa_1	We put in another day of hard work today, so let's just kick back and not worry about what's in store tomorrow.
sc366_spa_2	I feel like there's all this energy just bubbling up inside me. Hee hee!
sc366_spa_3	Phew, I'm beat. ...Hmm? Oh, no, not because of you. Hee hee. You DO know what I mean, though, right?
sc366_spa_4	I've been told there are some things that no amount of hard work can get you through. But I don't believe that one bit. I mean, what else have I got besides my work ethic?
sc366_spa_5	It's okay to make mistakes. We can work our way through fixing them together. No need to get spooked by a little slip-up, eh, Mr. Demon?
sc366_spa_max	You have dreams of your own, right, Mr. Demon? They'll come true, I promise! Let's work towards them together until they do!
sc367_spa_1	If only every day could be like today.
sc367_spa_2	Hrmph... Why is Mona always raving about this stupid place? I want out of this sweltering deathtrap! ...Huh? What? No! Nothing! Just trying to figure out what makes Mona tick!
sc367_spa_3	Ugh! This is how you treat an Archfiend? With a boring old bath like this? Hurry up and redecorate it for me! Blanket it with blood-red roses!
sc367_spa_4	Ahhh, yes, how refreshingly cool! This is just the right temperature for an Archfiend like me. Although, I guess a "cool" hot spring doesn't make much sense...
sc367_spa_5	You there! With the stupid haircut! Bow before me and swear your fealty! Do that, and you may leave with your life. Oh-ho-ho!
sc367_spa_max	If I get stronger than you, then you'll have to be MY child! And how lucky you'll be! Servant to Archfiend Davi! Oh-ho-ho!
sc370_spa_1	*sigh* Nothing like a soak to take away the weariness of travel!
sc370_spa_2	It's easy to forget what time of year it is when you dip into one of these hot springs. They're fascinating in that way—and so unlike back in the Infernal Realm.
sc370_spa_3	Oh, Master... Were you out looking for me? Aw, no need to be so worried! Let's head back, then. ...Hmmm? I've got it all wrong? Oh, come now—no need to be bashful!
sc370_spa_4	You don't have to act all shy like when we first met, you know. Teehee. I always look forward to this, you know ♥
sc370_spa_5	This bath is just perfect. But we should be going soon. I don't imagine you can put up with this for much longer, can you, my adorable little master? ♥ Teehee. Thank you for waiting.
sc370_spa_max	To think there are masters like you in the world... You know, my first time in battle was...well, no matter. Heh. That's all in the past now. And no good lady lets her past haunt her!
sc371_spa_1	Hopping from the cold bath to a hot one is the textbook definition of bliss. Ahhh...
sc371_spa_2	I might not be able to enjoy a life in the Mortal Realm the way Mona does, but I can at least pretend.
sc371_spa_3	It's comical, really. Demons and humans alike both seem to be drawn to hot baths like these. The warm waters must really touch something fundamental within all of us.
sc371_spa_4	I thought I had my health and fitness regimen in perfect balance, but coming here, I finally understand what people mean when they say they can't shake their exhaustion. Maybe this is more an emotional issue than a physical one.
sc371_spa_5	It's impossible to stay completely alert to something at all times, even if you have every intention to. The one part of ourselves we can't control is our mind. It's absurd, really.
sc371_spa_max	Heh, don't you worry. I'll be back to my usual self soon, and I'll see to it that you become Archfiend. Prepare yourself, though, because I'll be going all in.
sc372_spa_1	I like the sea more than hot springs.
sc372_spa_2	Heh heh! Now my skin is all silky smooth! And that breeze is soft as silk, too. I could get used to this.
sc372_spa_3	I lost one of my toys—a little floating rubber ducky. I snuck it in here when Mona wasn't looking. ...Wait, really? You'll help me find it?!
sc372_spa_4	It's all just water, right? So why are there different bathing suits for each type of bath or pool or whatever? Humans get so weird with their rules sometimes.
sc372_spa_5	Mona is really something else. How can she control that urge to just splash around in here? I guess it's all that training she's been through to be the top succubus. *blows bubbles*
sc372_spa_max	Heh heh! I worked out the greatest plan of all! They say there's this real great treasure in the middle of the ocean, and whoever finds it gets to be the new pirate king! Mona says it's too dangerous, so I figured you could help!
sc373_spa_1	Ahhh, I feel that in my bones... Oop, almost fell asleep back there.
sc373_spa_2	Come on, man, why are you hiding in the corner? Get over here!
sc373_spa_3	I think I could learn to like these "hot springs" or whatever they're called.
sc373_spa_4	Let's see which one of us can stay in longest!
sc373_spa_5	Hey, what's your go-to drink when you get out? Me? I'd have to go with coffee milk, probably.
sc373_spa_max	All right, when we head out, how's about I grab a coffee milk for ya? I won't take no for an answer!
sc374_spa_1	Oh, I am just so, so happy right now! ♥ I'd be even happier if you were here with me. Hee hee! ♥
sc374_spa_2	I think I like this place. I should tell Morgan and Pomona about it. Oh, but Morgan would never come alone.
sc374_spa_3	Over here, my little customer! ♥ How about the two of us get nice and warm together? ♥ Hey! Are you really going to run from me again? You really are a shy one.
sc374_spa_4	I'm really happiest whenever I'm with you, little customer ♥ Now if only you felt the same way about me...
sc374_spa_5	I'll look out for you, my little customer, don't you worry ♥ But first, I'm going to need you to throw a nice wedding for the two of us! Hee hee! ♥
sc374_spa_max	You know I'm really happy to have met you, yes? Thank you for becoming my master ♥
sc377_spa_1	Trying to shake off those marriage blues, hmm? Makes sense. I was just thinking I needed some time off, myself.
sc377_spa_2	I've never seen so many demons and Childs in one place before. I thought I'd find myself a bride and head straight back to the Infernal Realm once the Contest was over, but that might be tough while Pomona is here...
sc377_spa_3	I'm going to try and think of the past as a fun bunch of memories. ...What am I talking about, you ask? My plan to marry Pomona, of course. Don't you go poking fun—I wasn't going to give her a hard time.
sc377_spa_4	Are you okay? You look really worn out. If you're feeling sick, I can call the owner. Are you sure you can walk on your own?
sc377_spa_5	This is the first time I've relaxed so much since I took up the Bride's Ring. I was always surrounded by potential brides back on my island, you see.
sc377_spa_max	Well, I suppose your plan worked, because I feel I've come to know you a lot better. I'm not one to make friends, though, so...hm. Oh, you could announce yourself as another bridal candidate! Ahaha, I'm just kidding.
sc378_spa_1	Ahhh. Sometimes a nice soak is exactly what the doctor ordered.
sc378_spa_2	Hm? This place can heal wounds, too? That's good to know.
sc378_spa_3	These hot springs can heal your wounds, yes? That means I can fight against Athena without holding back, then, right?
sc378_spa_4	You think I should bathe alongside Athena? Don't be ridiculous.
sc378_spa_5	Does she... Does Athena come around here, too?
sc378_spa_max	Well, I guess if you insist, then... I wouldn't be against coming here with her.
sc379_spa_1	Bathing in the nude... How shameless!
sc379_spa_2	O-Oh... Is this what they mean by "baring everything" in a relationship?
sc379_spa_3	I think I've grown to like this so-called "hot spring." I can feel my injuries and fatigue washing away...
sc379_spa_4	Why do you turn away from me, Master?
sc379_spa_5	I wish I could bring you-know-who to this place. I'm sure she would enjoy it. Don't you agree, Master?
sc379_spa_max	Let's all come back here together again sometime.
sc381_spa_1	What have you got on your mind, bringing me to a place like this? Hm? ...You want to bathe together with me, is that it?
sc381_spa_2	Do you think my special love candy is unfair, too? I pour my heart into making it every time, you know!
sc381_spa_3	No matter how much time or thought you invest in it, love is tough. Maybe it's just something you figure out as you get older. What even IS true love...?
sc381_spa_4	Don't go treating me like a child. I'm just not used to this, that's all. The feelings I have for you are genuine.
sc381_spa_5	They say love makes people fools, and I'm starting to believe them. By the way, you're looking mighty handsome today. Hee hee... I'm just teasing.
sc381_spa_max	You don't even know what love is? I guess you're still basically a kid yourself, huh? Heh, but don't you worry—we can both figure this all out together.
sc382_spa_1	What? If you're going to whine, do it later. I'm sure you've got nothing good to say.
sc382_spa_2	This is supposed to be a hot spring from the Infernal Realm? A bit lukewarm, wouldn't you say? Isn't the Infernal Realm supposed to be all fire and brimstone? Not that I would know.
sc382_spa_3	Ugh. I never would have agreed to any pact if I knew I'd have to look after a demon... Does he even realize I'm the only reason he's still alive?
sc382_spa_4	You have as bad a mouth as Frej. I'm honestly impressed. I wish I could be as brazenly shameless as you.
sc382_spa_5	You'd have preferred a much more fabulous sort of Child, right? One that stands five meters tall, with claws and fangs and the like. That would have suited me much better...
sc382_spa_max	I've never been truly happy for so much as a single moment. I imagine the same goes for my pactmaker. I may have enjoyed myself here or there, but...only a little. Not that I expect you to understand. Ugh...
sc383_spa_1	Do we really have time to waste here? Man, you're laid-back to a fault.
sc383_spa_2	I feel like I always get the short end of the stick in the Mortal Realm. Just when things seem to be picking up, something has to go wrong...
sc383_spa_3	That Neamhain... I caught her making these weird dolls. I wanted to toss 'em, but it's hard to do when it's a doll of you...
sc383_spa_4	How did I wind up stuck with such a weak-ass punk? How am I supposed to uphold the "Bad Boy Frej" name like this? ...Hey! Don't you dare give me that look! I don't need your pity!
sc383_spa_5	I just don't get it. Why do both Eve and Lisa keep praising this guy? What's he got that I don't?
sc383_spa_max	I feel like I'm on cruise control to an early death at this rate. I wonder what Lisa meant when she told me to "get serious." Hey, wannabe... You be careful. Don't go dying until I'm the one doing the killing.
sc385_spa_1	Ahh, this feels so good...\I wish Miss Helena was here, though...
sc385_spa_2	Teehee. This is so nice...\There's no point in having a hot spring if you don't use it, right!
sc385_spa_3	My wish? I want to prove to Miss Helena that I'm a full-blown grown-up!
sc385_spa_4	Oh, Mr. Owner! You'd better appreciate that you get to go in a hot spring with me!
sc385_spa_5	What do I have to do to make these cantaloupes into watermelons...? Ah! Y-You didn't hear that, did you?! Don't be such a creep, Mr. Owner!
sc385_spa_max	I'll help you achieve your dream, Mr. Owner!\That's what we servants live for, after all.
sc386_spa_1	They say hot springs can cleanse your very soul.\It really is soothing in here...
sc386_spa_2	It's so nice and quiet here.\Don't you agree, Mr. Owner?
sc386_spa_3	M-My job? That's a secret...
sc386_spa_4	Do you believe in fortune telling?\Huh? It's childish? No it's not!\It can be really helpful.
sc386_spa_5	I want to do something to repay you, Mr. Owner. ...Oh, I know! Let me choose a swimsuit for you.
sc386_spa_max	I see you wore the swimsuit I got you. Thank you. I hope I can keep helping you out—as your partner.
sc387_spa_1	*yaaawn* Hot springs really are the best. I can feel the stress melting away.
sc387_spa_2	I'm so glad I got to meet everyone. Th-That goes for you, too, of course.
sc387_spa_3	Why do I like taking baths? Because they feel so good, of course! Plus, they really help with my stiff shoulders.
sc387_spa_4	You can talk to me about anything. If there's anything I can do to help, I'll do it! ...Huh? That's what worries you? Hmph.
sc387_spa_5	Watch this, Mr. Owner.\I'm gonna try imitating you!\...On second thought, that sounds kind of embarrassing.
sc387_spa_max	My grandmother and I always bathe together. She says it's important for families not to hide anything from one another.
sc390_spa_1	I'm so glad I followed Mom here.
sc390_spa_2	Long ago, Mom and I used to... Bah, now's not the time! Let's get this show on the road! My magic's supercalifragilistic!
sc390_spa_3	Huh? You want me to explain my magic tricks? *sigh* A true gentleman wouldn't ask that of a lady.
sc390_spa_4	The greatest magicians bounce back from their mistakes to reach even greater heights! Does that make you feel any better?
sc390_spa_5	The true thrill of magic lies in the surprise! Hee hee... This'll knock your socks off. I'll put on the greatest show of all time.
sc390_spa_max	Spectators like you are pretty rare. Hee hee hee... You're funny! Okay, I've got even more surprises in store for you!
sc391_spa_1	I'm merely resting a spell. The night is long and more festivities are yet to come!
sc391_spa_2	Hee hee hee. Even short dreams are meant to be enjoyed. Unending dreams just end up being painful, don't you think?
sc391_spa_3	Haha! Meeting you was a happy coincidence. Ailill and Typhon feel the same—especially Typhon. He never cared about anyone else before.
sc391_spa_4	You're pretty forward for someone who says he's shy. Maybe you don't realize it, but that's dangerous in its own way. ...What am I talking about? Think long and hard about it.
sc391_spa_5	Dreams are fun because they end in the morning. An unending illusion is no different from death. Please try to always keep in mind where you are and what you're doing.
sc391_spa_max	So? Have I made an impression? Do you have happy memories of me? If so, I'm glad! We're Samhain Party ♪ A dream that can only be seen on Halloween!
sc392_spa_1	I don't wanna go to a place like this with YOU. Where's Mona?
sc392_spa_2	Mona is everything to me. Don't you dare get between us.
sc392_spa_3	I only wanted to love Mona...but I guess I ended up hurting her.
sc392_spa_4	I've realized...that it's better for me to be away from Mona. That's all I can do.
sc392_spa_5	I get it now. Mona loves me more than anyone else. If only I'd realized that sooner...
sc392_spa_max	Protect me 'n Mona in my place—so that she can be even happier than me.
sc393_spa_1	It's rare for an aide to have such a magnanimous demon. Teehee ♥
sc393_spa_2	A world where everyone can exist in harmony... Teehee! That sounds like a dream.
sc393_spa_3	It was my dream to make my master into the Archfiend. But now...
sc393_spa_4	Will you abandon me someday? Teehee! Your reactions are always the best.
sc393_spa_5	Will you promise me that you'll create an Infernal Realm where everyone can live happily?
sc393_spa_max	You're proud to have me as your aide? Then do your best to be a worthy master.
sc394_spa_1	Shall I wash thy back, Master? Teehee, I'm just kidding. Oh my, look at you—you're beet-red!
sc394_spa_2	Were you surprised to see my courtesan form? D-Don't be like that. I know I need to study more. That's why I'm reading a book right now.
sc394_spa_3	Courtesan culture is fascinating. Women living together... Oh! Could this be the ideal world I'm after?
sc394_spa_4	Isn't courtesan language so interesting? Speaking of which, did you know the word "courtship" derived from courtesan culture?
sc394_spa_5	It is a courtesan's job to make a dream come true, if only for a single night. That is why they train and study every day. What is your dream, Master? To eat delicious food? That's too bad. I'm still working on my cooking skills.
sc394_spa_max	Apparently, the gorgeous kimono worn by courtesans are akin to wedding attire. Would you wear this kimono someday for me? Hm? "No way in hell?" Ugh, you're so churlish, Master.
sc395_spa_1	Thank you. I feel refreshed now. I hadn't realized how exhausted I was.
sc395_spa_2	*sigh* Perhaps I lacked determination. I underestimated the Archfiend Contest. Here I thought it would be over in a flash and I could return home.
sc395_spa_3	Hmmm. I've learned a lot since then. I realized that walking around in this outfit during the daytime would make people think I'm some kind of juvenile delinquent. I see now just how rough you had it.
sc395_spa_4	Don't get the wrong idea—I don't know what you think, but I still consider you an enemy. And yet you completely let your guard down around me. I suppose it's in your nature be vexing.
sc395_spa_5	You call out to me and show me kindness despite not knowing who I am. That's just like you. Do you understand now why I say you're so similar to humans?
sc395_spa_max	You and Frej may treat me like some kind of idiot, but I'm the only demon who has so clearly seen the sun set on the Mortal Realm. Hm? Did you just laugh? Did I say something funny?
sc396_spa_1	Hurry up! I was waiting for you, Kitty!
sc396_spa_2	You're still trembling with fear that I might run away, yeah? It's fiiine. This form's really fun.
sc396_spa_3	The world is so big that you'll never be able to see all of it in a single lifetime. Knowing that, doesn't it seem stupid to stay in one place?
sc396_spa_4	Aw, don't be sad. You're really special to me, Kitty. Ahaha! You look like you don't believe me at all!
sc396_spa_5	Something tells me...that parting is just the start of a new set of encounters. All I know is that we'll definitely meet again.
sc396_spa_max	Don't worry. Even if we can't see each other, it's not like we'll be apart forever, Kitty. I'll come whenever you call.
sc397_spa_1	Delivering presents, bringing joy to countless people, and on top of that, a nice warm bath... This is the life!
sc397_spa_2	How do you like my Santa outfit? Doesn't it look wonderful? A queen must give the common people what they want every now and then! ...What? They're the ones doing ME a favor? How rude!
sc397_spa_3	Chicken is a must at Christmastime! Hm? What else will we eat, you ask? A whole roast turkey. Wait, that's practically the same as chicken.
sc397_spa_4	Christmas is such a sublime occasion! We should celebrate it every day. Hm? That would be hard on Santa? Yes, I suppose you're right.
sc397_spa_5	What's a good present, you ask? Hmmm, perhaps something that can fetch a good price? I used to sell my gifts for money. ...What's with that look? These days, I think I'd prefer a delicious meal.
sc397_spa_max	I'm usually the one who receives gifts. That's why I hadn't realized how good it feels to give. You'll treasure my gift, won't you, Servant?
sc398_spa_1	So waaarm... Makes me glad to be alive.
sc398_spa_2	How the heck am I gonna swipe the Hades Flower?\What the...? Were you eavesdroppin'?
sc398_spa_3	What do I care\about the Archfiend Contest?!\I've had about all I can take of demons!
sc398_spa_4	You wanna be friends?\I suppose you are different\from other demons.\Still, it ain't happenin'!
sc398_spa_5	Demons are all thieves.\At least, that's what I used to think.\But I've had to rethink that since meetin' you.
sc398_spa_max	Why be scared of fightin' other demons?\You've got nothin' to fear, long as I'm here.
sc400_spa_1	This's a nice place. I wanted to bring Mama and the others too, but...I can't, can I?
sc400_spa_2	I was always with my family. Well, not anymore. No matter how much time passes, I just can't get used to being apart from them.
sc400_spa_3	Did you know that people become butterflies when they die? Maybe they're born from the wishes of those who love the dearly departed.
sc400_spa_4	You look lonely sometimes, Master. But you have such a huge family! You're just plain greedy.
sc400_spa_5	Hey, Master. Would you put more trust in me? I wanna fight for you.
sc400_spa_max	I'll protect you, Master. After all, you're my family. You consider me family too, right?
sc402_spa_1	I'm still in the midst of my investigation, and yet...
sc402_spa_2	It's nice to relax like this every now and then.
sc402_spa_3	Hot springs always make me think of hot spring eggs. Maybe I'll try making one.
sc402_spa_4	Why are you staring at me like that?
sc402_spa_5	An important part of work is recovering from daily exhaustion!
sc402_spa_max	I'd love to come here with Makoto and Tsubaki sometime.
sc403_spa_1	A hot spring! Sweet!
sc403_spa_2	Whoa, the fur on my tail is floating!
sc403_spa_3	Come on, relaaax!
sc403_spa_4	This place is nice and all, but it makes me wonder how it compares to other hot springs.
sc403_spa_5	Hot springs are especially nice after working up a sweat.
sc403_spa_max	Come on in! You'll warm up even more if you join me!
sc404_spa_1	This doesn't compare to the humiliation I suffered.
sc404_spa_2	Why did you get in before me?!
sc404_spa_3	The bath here is rather nice, isn't it?
sc404_spa_4	Even I grow exhausted at times.
sc404_spa_5	A mere hot spring shouldn't be so...rejuvenating.
sc404_spa_max	Too bad we can't go in together...don't you think?
sc405_spa_1	I suppose I must admit there was SOME merit in choosing to trust and follow you.
sc405_spa_2	The Archfiend must have certain qualities,\which you lack rather profoundly.
sc405_spa_3	What kind of Archfiend do you wish to become?\Are you confident that you can rule the Infernal Realm?
sc405_spa_4	Sir Rufus must become king of the Infernal Realm.\He is the sole demon able to create something\from nothing.
sc405_spa_5	I am only helping you\because Sir Rufus ordered me to.\In any case, I will do my best.
sc405_spa_max	Sir Rufus's orders are absolute.\I will offer my utmost cooperation until he says otherwise.
sc406_spa_1	Purrfect...
sc406_spa_2	Hot springs are so wonderful.
sc406_spa_3	Aaahhh!
sc406_spa_4	This water is awesome!
sc406_spa_5	I'm not allowed to swim?
sc406_spa_max	Hot springs are the best!
sc407_spa_1	*sigh* Hot springs feel so nice. Fennec should come in too.
sc407_spa_2	This feels pretty good.
sc407_spa_3	I dipped my shoulders in and counted up to thirty!
sc407_spa_4	I-I won't swim around, promise!
sc407_spa_5	*sigh* I feel like I'm in paradise.
sc407_spa_max	Next time I'll invite Fennec to come, too.
sc408_spa_1	This is such a great place.
sc408_spa_2	Aaah, it's so warm.
sc408_spa_3	Ringtail, did you count up to thirty?
sc408_spa_4	No swimming allowed.
sc408_spa_5	You're not dizzy, are you?
sc408_spa_max	Ringtail, let's come here again.
sc409_spa_1	Let's splash around!
sc409_spa_2	Aren't I just like a marshmallow donut right now? *gasp* Oh no! What'll I do if I melt?
sc409_spa_3	Soaking in hot water for sooo long makes me feel like I've turned into a donut. Didja know? Some donuts are boiled in water!
sc409_spa_4	Don'tcha think donuts are best when you eat them while they're still piping hot? That's why saving them for last just 'cuz you like 'em is the worst thing you could do!
sc409_spa_5	All the blood's gone to my head and I'm redder than red. But doesn't it make me look like a strawberry donut? Wanna have a taste of me, Master? Teehee ♥
sc409_spa_max	*sigh* ♥ This feels so good ♥ Next time, I'll bring some donuts for us to eat! ♥ What's with that look? You're the one who taught me how fun it is to share with other people!
sc410_spa_1	Did you think something like\this would satisfy me?\Bring me some cold water.
sc410_spa_2	Oh my! If it isn't the little master.\What, got something to say?\I'm only telling the truth. You're little.
sc410_spa_3	What if the Archfiend couldn't rule the Infernal Realm?\We could fight all day, every day.\Isn't that exciting?
sc410_spa_4	Thank your lucky stars that you met me.\This is the first and last time\I'll ever be someone's familiar.
sc410_spa_5	I'll give you a crown.\Now, kneel and accept my gracious gift.
sc410_spa_max	If you wish to become Archfiend, I'll help you in any way I can.\In exchange, you must show me a place\where I can fight to my heart's content.
sc412_spa_1	Give me the courage to not be swayed\by Satan's snares.
sc412_spa_2	Hey, Abel.\It's shaping up to be another enjoyable day.\It was the Lord's guidance that allowed us to meet like this.
sc412_spa_3	Abel, are you skipping work again?\I worry about your frivolous ways.\Although, I suppose you'll do just fine on your own.\You are my little brother.
sc412_spa_4	Hadn't seen you for a time there, Abel.\Oh, what's this?\Have you grown shy?\Haha, I kid.
sc412_spa_5	I always dream that I'm scolding you.\I'm lost in a rage and hollering...you...\Oh, but listen to me, what am I saying?\I must be tired.\Let's go home.
sc412_spa_max	If we go back to the Vatican we can be together again.\I have a cute disciple now. It would be fun.\I hope you like her, too.\Virupa's a wonderful disciple.\But she yet wants for training. We have much to teach her.
sc414_spa_1	Water gun fights aren't allowed at hot springs. Even a Hydro Shooter knows that.
sc414_spa_2	I won't turn my gun on an opponent who's fleeing. That's my water gun fight philosophy.
sc414_spa_3	Is Annie still going on about that? Like I said before, the eighth win wasn't Annie's—it was mine.
sc414_spa_4	If someone picks a fight with me, I'll take 'em on. That's the creed of all gunners—which is exactly why you don't have what it takes to be a Hydro Shooter.
sc414_spa_5	I have a lot of stuff I wanna talk with you about, so I've been waiting. First up: let's dish about the newest water gun model!
sc414_spa_max	You oughta teach the people who make fun of you a lesson. You're a more amazing demon than you think, y'know.
sc415_spa_1	Cool mountain streams are nice, but lukewarm hot springs ain't bad either.
sc415_spa_2	How can you enjoy summer if'n ya don't like getting wet?
sc415_spa_3	Don't be scared of yer opponent's muzzle. Only those who press forward without lookin' back can become Hydro Shooters.
sc415_spa_4	Put everythin' you've got on the line and face yer opponent. That's what bein' a Hydro Shooter's about.
sc415_spa_5	Quit spacin' out way over there 'n come in the water already. Heh heh heh...
sc415_spa_max	Yer opponent's strength ain't important. You're the one who holds the key to victory. I might just become that key for you, if yer lucky.
sc416_spa_1	Oh yeah. This is a secret, but...\I'll tell you anyway.\That lady's been staring at you\this whole time.
sc416_spa_2	Huh?\I thought I heard someone.\Oh, don't worry.\I'm sure it was just my imagination.
sc416_spa_3	If you walk around here by yourself,\you can see a strange light.\It's not from fireflies or stars.\It's a kind of sad, melancholy light.
sc416_spa_4	Strange stuff happens everywhere,\whether it's the Mortal Realm or the Infernal Realm.\Don't be so scared.\It's actually pretty fun to watch from afar.
sc416_spa_5	I thought you were pathetic,\but you're actually just a scaredy-cat.\That's not really befitting of a demon, though.\Ha ha ha!
sc416_spa_max	You're actually jealous of humans, aren't you?\Ha ha ha! That face says it all.\I never get tired of watching you.\
sc417_spa_1	Hey now! Do NOT touch my tail without permission.
sc417_spa_2	You want to touch my tail that much? Fine... Just be gentle.
sc417_spa_3	I wish to eat your grilled meat here as well. Even a small amount will suffice, so long as you have cooked it yourself.
sc417_spa_4	Finding new love is no simple matter. Ah... I wonder if someone over there will become my partner?
sc417_spa_5	Recently, my appetite for meat is sated much more easily. And that is because...you yourself have satisfied me.
sc417_spa_max	I am sure you've noticed, but meat is a necessity for me. However, if I had to choose between meat and you, I would choose you. That is all.
sc418_spa_1	Ahhh... This is a very...relaxing place.
sc418_spa_2	This hot spring feels so wonderful, it's almost like one of Tamamo's charms. Marvelous...
sc418_spa_3	I have fought evil and protected everyone...precisely for this moment.
sc418_spa_4	Ahhh. I know I can't let my guard down no matter the circumstances, but every time I come here, my heart melts.
sc418_spa_5	On occasion, I've mused that the warmth of a hot spring and the warmth of a heart are very similar. Don't you think so too, Boss?
sc418_spa_max	This place really does feel great. If only everyone could feel the way I do right now—then maybe the world would be more peaceful.
sc419_spa_1	Uh... Would you mind not staring at me like that? It's kinda creepy.
sc419_spa_2	...You must like what you see.
sc419_spa_3	Welcome.
sc419_spa_4	It's okay. But it's a bit embarrassing...
sc419_spa_5	So... How do you feel about me...?
sc419_spa_max	You're gonna make me say it? You're so kinky…
sc420_spa_1	Ah, I feel so refreshed.
sc420_spa_2	There something you want to tell me?
sc420_spa_3	Hey, don't give me that look.
sc420_spa_4	...Am I really that undesirable to you?
sc420_spa_5	Have you been busy recently?\Or has something been weighing on your mind?
sc420_spa_max	I love you.
sc421_spa_1	Hmmm-hmmm ♪
sc421_spa_2	Don't worry. It's nothing.
sc421_spa_3	I'll be waiting, so please come again.
sc421_spa_4	Know that I'll always be there for you.
sc421_spa_5	I tried to hide\my feelings from you.
sc421_spa_max	I love you.
sc422_spa_1	You're so funny, my little demon.\You sure go out of your way to score points with me\considering you supposedly can't stand me.
sc422_spa_2	How could the population become so low?\*sigh* What's the world coming to?
sc422_spa_3	First, you get squeaky clean.\And then, you know what happens, right?
sc422_spa_4	I must get the bed nice and clean.\Hygiene is very important.
sc422_spa_5	The first time is nerve-wracking, isn't it?\Not to worry.\I'll take the lead. ♥
sc422_spa_max	Did you not say you would grant my wish?\I think it's about time\you followed through. ♥
sc423_spa_1	Oh...\Is this what heaven is like?\
sc423_spa_2	Ahhh.\This hot spring is fantastic.\When I get married,\I want a house with a hot spring included.\*sigh* I feel like I'm gonna melt.
sc423_spa_3	Sometimes I wonder\if my fetish for weaklings\has anything to do with gender after all.
sc423_spa_4	I had a dream the other day.\I was in a fantastical garden, surrounded by feeble male demons.\...Oh, no no no, darling!\You're the only one I love! I promise!
sc423_spa_5	When you're not around,\it feels like something is missing.\Please stay by my side always, darling.\Teehee... Hee hee hee...
sc423_spa_max	At my ideal hot spring...\the towels and foot mats would all be your clothes, darling.\And the ceiling and walls would be decorated with your clothes as well!\...Oh, leaving already, darling?\No, no! Please wait!
sc425_spa_1	His mercy is infinite.\How can I leave Him?
sc425_spa_2	I do my best to follow your commands\because you are the one who gives me purpose.
sc425_spa_3	No one can truly understand God's will.\Therefore, arrogant one, wait for the time to come.
sc425_spa_4	Do you know what is right or wrong? Do you know\where our paths end?
sc425_spa_5	When our battle is over, God will host a banquet.\But there will be no place set for me...
sc425_spa_max	God created my body.\But who placed my soul in it?
sc426_spa_1	I'm not interested in relaxation.
sc426_spa_2	Hmmm... Staying in here for a long time is harder than I thought.\*sigh* I'm so hot.
sc426_spa_3	Ugh... I gotta endure it! I can't lose to a bunch of hot water! But I feel like I'm starting to see stars.\Or is that my imagination?
sc426_spa_4	Haaah... Master, I feel kind of...odd. Why am I so dizzy\and hot? I-I can't get out yet, though.
sc426_spa_5	*sigh* I can't...stand it... Hm? You're giving me a cool towel? Are you telling me to hang in there a bit longer?\But if I stay and end up fainting, will you carry me out on your back?
sc426_spa_max	I'll count to three and we'll both get out. Once we're out, let's have another competition.\We'll snuggle under some warm covers and see who can stay awake longest. Okay, I'm gonna count. One, two, three...
sc428_spa_1	One day, everything—the wind, even the sound of birds chirping—will\come to a stop.
sc428_spa_2	Hear that?\The angels have declared war on you.
sc428_spa_3	Birth and death are predestined. You can't\resist your destiny.
sc428_spa_4	The scales have been tipped. What can you do\to restore balance?
sc428_spa_5	Doomsday is nigh. Choose your side.\You've only two choices: the right or the left.
sc428_spa_max	Salvation comes from the highest and also the lowest of all places.\Can you be saved?
sc429_spa_1	Please keep this a secret from Flins.\I need to spend time by myself every once in a while.
sc429_spa_2	I would love to recommend this place to Flins as well.\Oh, but maybe this would be a little too hot for him?
sc429_spa_3	You're scared of Flins?\But he's such a weak Child.
sc429_spa_4	Neither of us are particularly demonic, are we?\Hee hee.
sc429_spa_5	Being used by others is inevitable.\After all, I'm far too kind a demon—\just as Flins says.\Hee hee.
sc429_spa_max	Thank you for understanding me.\I feel as though I've met an old friend.\No wonder Flins gets jealous.\Hee hee.
sc430_spa_1	Did I SAY I wanted to come to a place like this?\...I mean,\not like it's especially terrible or anything.
sc430_spa_2	You're such a pain.\I'm regaining my energy.\Leave me alone.
sc430_spa_3	Huh?\You've never gone hunting?\Are you serious?\Aren't you an Archfiend candidate?
sc430_spa_4	There's a moment when everything else fades away\and all you can see is your prey.\That's when you pull the trigger.
sc430_spa_5	You hate someone? They're your enemy.\Someone hates you? They're your enemy.\Simple, right?
sc430_spa_max	Trust in me and me alone. Ziva told me to take care of you, and I'm not gonna let her down.
sc431_spa_1	This place always rules.
sc431_spa_2	Going from some fun skiing to relaxing at a hot spring...\Couldn't think of a better combination.
sc431_spa_3	Since we're always together, isn't it about time we got married?\...Huh? I was just messing with him,\but he ran off.\He's so funny.
sc431_spa_4	Aaah!\You were peeking, weren't you?\Hmm, maybe I'll tell your aides.
sc431_spa_5	This is the lap of luxury. I love it!\And I owe it all to you.\I'll have to return the favor sometime.
sc431_spa_max	Is there anything you want?\I'm in a good mood, so I'll get it for you—\just so long as it isn't money.
sc432_spa_1	Are you trying to impress me?\You're foolish.
sc432_spa_2	How come everyone's so desperate to tame me?\So pathetic!
sc432_spa_3	You're acting as if nothing's wrong,\but I can tell. You regret meeting me, don't you?
sc432_spa_4	That's a funny thing to say:\you trust me.
sc432_spa_5	Don't let your reason dictate you. Follow\your instinct. That's who you really are.
sc432_spa_max	I have to say, I don't dislike being with you.\I actually rather enjoy it. Ho ho. ♥ I look forward to our future together.
sc433_spa_1	Wh-Wh-Who said it was okay to sneak a peek?\You little perv.\Seriously...
sc433_spa_2	*yawn*\I'm so sleepy all of a sudden.\Dang it. I wanted to talk to you the whole time.
sc433_spa_3	I'm jealous.\Everyone gets to live with you...\I wanna...live with you...\Yawn!
sc433_spa_4	I'll never give up on you, Chief.\I'm gonna win in the end.
sc433_spa_5	You wanna know why I like you?\I'm just so happy when we're together...\That's why there's nobody else for me but you!
sc433_spa_max	I don't care what anybody says, you're mine.\And you like me, too, right Chief?\You think I'm super duper cute, don't you?\Tee hee. ♥
sc434_spa_1	So nice and warm...\The water is just right.
sc434_spa_2	Are you that disinclined to become my servant?\How very strange.
sc434_spa_3	You're the only one acting as my servant, you know.
sc434_spa_4	Why do you hide yourself from me?\Is my beauty too great?\Heh heh, well, aren't you precious?
sc434_spa_5	I need no chocolates.\I already know that you're enamored with me.\Heh heh.
sc434_spa_max	I've been feeling rather good lately.\Ever since you became my servant, in fact.\Just a thought. ♥
sc435_spa_1	Would you mind not staring at me?\Let's have some candy together.
sc435_spa_2	You took your sweet time!\You don't care about me at all, do you?
sc435_spa_3	That was a pretty rough day today, huh?\Let's unwind with some sweet, sweet candy.
sc435_spa_4	It's okay if you're unreliable and mess up all the time.\So long as you're my cute, little Mr. Demon.
sc435_spa_5	I feel an ache in my chest...\Is this love?
sc435_spa_max	I hope my love can reach your heart\and fill it up!
sc436_spa_1	*yawn*\I feel like I might pass out.\This place is so peaceful.
sc436_spa_2	Once the Archfiend Contest is over,\I wanna live a quiet life with Sytry.\I wonder how she'd feel about that.
sc436_spa_3	My world is filled with Sytry's fragrance.\If this is all a dream...\I hope I never, ever wake up.
sc436_spa_4	Sytry really seems to like you, Mr. Demon.\I'm not too sure how I feel about that...\But as long as she's happy,\that's fine by me.
sc436_spa_5	Love is more powerful than anything.\Pain, sadness... In the face of love,\they fade in a puff of smoke.
sc436_spa_max	Simply put,\Sytry's the reason I help you.\Still, I think she's right.\You are a good demon.
sc437_spa_1	*yawn*\It's so warm.\I could melt away.\Hehe...
sc437_spa_2	Hehe.\I just had a good idea.\What if you put a bunch of chocolate in the hot spring?
sc437_spa_3	Master, guess what.\Apparently, chocolate has this thing called cacao in it.\I wanna try some!\
sc437_spa_4	Chocolate is the flavor of love, right?\If you eat it every day you'll be chock-full of love.
sc437_spa_5	A long time ago, chocolate used to be medicine.\Master, if you pass out, I'll feed you some.\Hehe.
sc437_spa_max	Oh, Master.\My heart melted just like chocolate!\Hehe.
sc438_spa_1	This is good. I was exhausted.\Ahh... I'm going to have a good night's sleep tonight.
sc438_spa_2	Hey, don't just stand there. Entertain me!
sc438_spa_3	Hmm, so you also want something. Don't be so coy\and speak clearly. Who knows? Loki might grant it to you.
sc438_spa_4	Everything you love will crumble into pieces.\But don't worry. Loki will replace it.
sc438_spa_5	I had a dream that my memories with him crumbled into dust.\I'm scared. Without him, I...
sc438_spa_max	My king. My groom. My everything...\My Loki. If I could die in your arms...
sc439_spa_1	Self-control is fundamental for a pop star.
sc439_spa_2	The training never ends.\I do it all for Maestro.
sc439_spa_3	It's good to be a little more open and honest.\I think that way\Maestro will realize how I feel.
sc439_spa_4	I'm always so grateful to Maestro.\I owe this new life to him.
sc439_spa_5	There are things you can't say even when you want to.\Don't give up, though.\If you're brave, you'll be able to say them.
sc439_spa_max	I like you.\I want to be with you forever.\Oh, this is—!\I'm practicing my confession of love.
sc440_spa_1	Ahh! Soaking in a hot spring is so relaxing.
sc440_spa_2	I'll never get tired of bathing in the hot springs.\Let's come here more often.
sc440_spa_3	Sometimes I wish I could stay here all day.\It'd be wonderful, don't you think?
sc440_spa_4	Ah, my little master. What brings you here?\Hee hee. Why don't you come over here and enjoy bathing with me?
sc440_spa_5	Ah, I've been in the hot springs for a long time today.\Of course, I'd love to stay longer, if you don't mind. ♡
sc440_spa_max	Thank you for bringing me to the hot springs.\Let me give you a hug. Hey, you don't have to run away. ♡
sc441_spa_1	I feel sorry for enjoying this all by myself.
sc441_spa_2	This place is incredible. Hey demon, tell me about this\hot spring. Oh? You're not running away, are you?
sc441_spa_3	And just like that, my fatigue is gone!\I want to come here every day!
sc441_spa_4	Robin of Justice never betrays her loyalties.\So call on me whenever you need my help, demon.
sc441_spa_5	I think we work well together.\What do you think, demon?
sc441_spa_max	Pretend as you may, I know the truth--you're a kind and\upstanding demon. Ah! Your face is turning red. Hehe.
sc442_spa_1	Everything, both black and white, comes from you.\Be careful not to lean tow either side.
sc442_spa_2	Everything, even happiness and sorrow, is meaningless. Poor wretch,\what is it that you really want?
sc442_spa_3	Despair not. Even evil can turn to Buddha.\I know you can.
sc442_spa_4	I don't regret meeting you.\I exist because of you.
sc442_spa_5	Demon, show me your goodness.\I'll bet my life on you.
sc442_spa_max	I can't wait to see what future our meeting\will lead us to.
sc443_spa_1	This is unexpected.\How'd you find such a nice spot?
sc443_spa_2	I wish Logan were here with us.
sc443_spa_3	I have a question.\Why are you here?
sc443_spa_4	Wonder why I give warning of my arrival?\Because I know what I can do.
sc443_spa_5	I miss working with you.\If you change your mind, please let Logan know.
sc443_spa_max	We Phantom Thieves should be able to pilfer anything.\One day, maybe even someone's heart.
sc445_spa_1	Sometimes, it's necessary to retreat and rest.\To prepare for a new battle.
sc445_spa_2	There's no goddess...\Only a girl who doesn't know anything.
sc445_spa_3	Who knew I'd shake hands with a demon one day?
sc445_spa_4	Would I be freed from the pain of my past\if I find enlightenment?
sc445_spa_5	"I exist because of you."\I've realized that only now.
sc445_spa_max	Now, I know why Nirrti relies on\you so much.
sc446_spa_1	You're a lucky one.
sc446_spa_2	What changes should you rest here?\You are born with your strength.
sc446_spa_3	I should bring Juno and Tiwaz here.\They might stop fighting for a while.
sc446_spa_4	Even though the marital quarrels are tiring,\Amos Island is not a bad place.
sc446_spa_5	Do you believe in a soul mate? As for me, I'm not sure...\If you're truly lucky, maybe you meet such a person.
sc446_spa_max	You say funny things from time to time.\You're an interesting one.
sc447_spa_1	I'm a traveler heading to hell.\Is this a haven for poor travelers like me? Heh heh.
sc447_spa_2	God doesn't listen to the prayers of evildoers...\Well, maybe he would, accidentally, if you kept trying.
sc447_spa_3	If you're so angry, then pray. If you cry loudly enough,\maybe God will listen to you.
sc447_spa_4	I'll pray that mercy and peace be with you.\Oh wait, that's a curse to you demons, isn't it?
sc447_spa_5	You look troubled. Whatever your problems, forget them.\You can't do anything about them right now. Come on, let yourself rest for the day.
sc447_spa_max	Say, has your impression about me changed yet?\I'm more demonic than a demon, don't you think? Heh heh.
sc448_spa_1	I prefer blood to water. This is... disappointing.
sc448_spa_2	Aah... You smell sweet.\Like fresh blood. My favorite.
sc448_spa_3	Hot springs are good for your skin, right?\I should frequent here more often. Thank you for your advice.
sc448_spa_4	I hate hypocrites.\They disgust me.
sc448_spa_5	It's disheartening you think all vampires are bad.\I wish you would think well of me.
sc448_spa_max	Sweetheart, how'd you like to be my familiar?\I don't make this offer to just anyone. You should be honored.
sc449_spa_1	Finally, I can relax. Aah... This feels so good.\I wish it could always be this way.
sc449_spa_2	You don't mess with others—even vampires—when they're resting.\I don't get to rest often. Leave me alone!
sc449_spa_3	Ugh, I hate these mountains, but...\Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to bathe in a mountain spring.
sc449_spa_4	Is that... food?\Wh-Why don't you set that there and then we talk?
sc449_spa_5	You're pretty useful for a demon. You won't age or die, either.\Maybe you could serve me once I become immortal.
sc449_spa_max	I'm not going to let anything distract me until I achieve my desire.\But perhaps after, who knows...?
sc450_spa_1	Phew...\It's a bit hot, but I can handle it.\I'll get used to it in no time.
sc450_spa_2	I don't want to be apart from Attis.
sc450_spa_3	It's as though my heart and body are cleansed.\Shall I wash your back, Demon?
sc450_spa_4	Falling in love is frightening,\but it's everything to me.
sc450_spa_5	Thank you...for always listening to me.\I'd like to hear about you, too.
sc450_spa_max	If I pluck up the courage,\my feelings should come through.\I'll make them known properly this time.
sc451_spa_1	Nothing like a hot spring to wash a day's tiredness away,\wouldn't you agree?
sc451_spa_2	That look... What are you scheming?
sc451_spa_3	I've got such a craving.\What I wouldn't give for a marron glacé right now.
sc451_spa_4	Kasumi read my fortune once.\It was a little awkward,\but I didn't hate it.\
sc451_spa_5	You look tired.\Why not try getting a beauty treatment?\Shall I introduce you to a friend of mine who's incredibly skilled?
sc451_spa_end	Is that the time?\I'll be heading out soon.
sc451_spa_max	Wanna go shopping together next time?\I wanna get a new swimsuit.\You'd be carrying my things around, of course.\Hehe.
sc452_spa_1	Hee hee. Being supple really helps with T'ai Chi Ch'uan, you know.
sc452_spa_2	Aren't you embarrassed being here?\You've got guts.
sc452_spa_3	Can you let the owner know\the time of the swimsuit photo shoot changed?\I just stuffed my face.\You get what I'm saying, right?
sc452_spa_4	Do Hitomi and I get along?\We do, but we kinda don't?\See, she's my rival.\I have no intention of losing to her. ♪
sc452_spa_5	I'm getting some new clothes tonight.\Can you help me?\Hee hee. Did you think I was asking you out?\Oh, absolutely not. ♪
sc452_spa_end	I enjoyed the hot spring to the fullest.\Maybe I'll do some aromatherapy, too.
sc452_spa_max	If I beat Hitomi in a cook-off,\I'll let you try what I made.\A special treat just for you. ♪
sc453_spa_1	There's a lovely hot spring on Amos Island.\I will invite you properly next time.
sc453_spa_2	Tiwaz received a proposal again?\*sigh* If Juno finds out about this...
sc453_spa_3	Tiwaz is the sunshine itself to me.\I learned what happiness is thanks to her.
sc453_spa_4	Everyone has their own charms. Even if they aren't\visually appealing. Take... you, for example.
sc453_spa_5	If you say nothing, no one will know. If you love someone, you need to say it.\So?
sc453_spa_max	Love is difficult, but you cannot stop feelings of attraction. Hehe! Your face is red. I wonder why?
sc454_spa_1	I came here after hearing so much about it...\Well, it's not too bad.
sc454_spa_2	Seems like there's some people who aren't too fond of me...\Well, I don't care. I'm the one who's at Tiwaz's side.
sc454_spa_3	Tiwaz came here as well? Hmm...\Nobody bothered her, right?
sc454_spa_4	A mask is essential for someone like me. Who am I? Well... What do your eyes tell you?
sc454_spa_5	Tiwaz might abandon me one day. If it comes to that... I might actually die. Ha..
sc454_spa_max	There's some decent guys among Tiwaz's friends.\You don't seem half bad either.
sc455_spa_1	Stay with me. Let's have a chat.\Oh? Your face is red. Are you not feeling well?
sc455_spa_2	Sometimes, I can't tell what Juno is thinking.\He says he's happy, but is he telling the truth?
sc455_spa_3	Juno is special to me. I'm being honest...\But why does no one believe me?
sc455_spa_4	I hate being alone.\But it's impossible to keep everyone around, right?
sc455_spa_5	Thinking back, I didn't know what love was.\But now, I do. Hee hee...
sc455_spa_max	Thank you for being my friend. I'm not lonely anymore.\Thanks to you.
sc456_spa_1	Oh, this feels so wonderful! My skin feels so smooth, too.\Want to touch? Oh, my... Do you really want to touch me?
sc456_spa_2	I'm honored to serve Juno.\Because well, at least he's handsome.
sc456_spa_3	Amos Island is peaceful and quiet.\I'd love to spend the rest of my life here.
sc456_spa_4	I wish there was a spa on Amos Island.\Perhaps, I should talk to Juno about that.
sc456_spa_5	The weather's great. The mood's great. It's a great day.\Except that I'm not with the a person I desire.
sc456_spa_max	Sir Demon, maybe I'm so used to seeing you now,\but for a moment, you looked handsome.
sc457_spa_1	This place has a gentle charm to it.\It's almost as pleasant as teatime.
sc457_spa_2	As a butler,\I hear more than you'd think.
sc457_spa_3	On Amos Island, you can recover your vitality.\Seems like you could use a rest, too.
sc457_spa_4	I want to travel one day.\So that I may fulfill my pactmaker's will...
sc457_spa_max	So long as the pactmaker's will remains within me,\he will continue to live on.
sc458_spa_1	Hmm... Are we seeing who can stay in the hot water longer?
sc458_spa_2	Aww... I'm so relaxed... I can't keep my eyes open...\Ah! This is a trap! I almost fell for it!
sc458_spa_3	Sports are synonymous with pain.\Come on, pour more hot water on me!
sc458_spa_4	The moment you give up, you lose the race.\My life is meaningless outside racing...
sc458_spa_5	This place is too nice to be wasted on a dumb fight.\You're pretty nice, too.
sc458_spa_max	That was a good bit of sport. You're a worthy opponent.
sc459_spa_1	Hm... I wish Cacus was here...
sc459_spa_2	Ahhh... I can feel my fatigue melting away.\Where's Cacus?
sc459_spa_3	Ah... Cacus... I hope she's not getting herself into trouble again...
sc459_spa_4	It's true I spend a lot of time with Cacus,\but she's my sister.
sc459_spa_5	I'm fine so long as you take care of Cacus.\She may not seem like it, but she's sweet.
sc459_spa_max	Truth be told, I've been so busy taking care of Cacus that I neglected myself.\Thank you. I feel much better now.
sc460_spa_1	This place smells wonderful.\I'd love to come back here with her.
sc460_spa_2	How much can I trust you?\Nothing can change the fact that you're a demon...
sc460_spa_3	Childs are not tools, at least to me.\My Child was my friend—my family.
sc460_spa_4	All precious things disappear eventually.\I wonder if she was taken from me because I cherished her.
sc460_spa_5	Cacia thinks I just play the hero,\but I really do want to be a hero for Childs one day.
sc460_spa_max	When I become Archfiend, I'll create a world\in which no Child has to suffer.
sc461_spa_1	Demon, this place is expensive, isn't it?\I know you don't have money, so I won't stay too long.
sc461_spa_2	Every day I waited for you.\It was hard, but it's okay now. We're together again.
sc461_spa_3	What do you think, demon?\Do I shine as beautifully as I did before?
sc461_spa_4	No need to hurry.\Our house isn't going anywhere.
sc461_spa_5	I thought about what to say when you returned. But now that you're here,\I'm so happy that I can't think of anything else.
sc461_spa_max	Don't worry. We'll be happy one day.\I'll make sure of it.
sc462_spa_1	Have you seen Sayoko?\Hehe. She can be so shy sometimes.
sc462_spa_2	No one gets to forgive her.\They all left her. I... I'm a sinner, just like her.
sc462_spa_3	I can't be Sayoko's light.\I can only walk beside her in the darkness.
sc462_spa_4	I may not be able to save Sayoko,\but I can be the shade under which she hides from the rest of the world.
sc462_spa_5	I don't care if you're a demon or God.\I can be a demon myself if it's to protect Sayoko.
sc462_spa_max	Aim for a higher place.\Sayoko and I will watch you from the lowest parts of the earth.
sc463_spa_1	This place is a bit...noisy. Can we go somewhere quieter?
sc463_spa_2	It's not like I want to be so bad at directions.\So, can you stop nagging me?
sc463_spa_3	Tell me the truth, kid. You're not ready\to accept me yet, are you? You're soft.
sc463_spa_4	If you're just going to stare, please leave.\Unless you want to join me. Ha ha.
sc463_spa_5	I admit I'm lucky to have met you,\but that doesn't mean I'll tolerate that arrogant look.
sc463_spa_max	I'm afraid the threads of our fates are entangled.\I've no choice but to stay with you.
sc464_spa_1	I haven't felt so peaceful for a long time.
sc464_spa_2	Form is emptiness; emptiness is form.\Everything that exists doesn't exist at the same time.
sc464_spa_3	The more I cleanse my mind, the more I realize\nothing is entirely pure. What really is good?
sc464_spa_4	A wound only becomes the past when it's scabbed over.\Your wound is still open.
sc464_spa_5	Once I wanted to punish all evil. But then,\I met you and realized I must embrace evil.
sc464_spa_max	Would I meet you if I were born again?\Would we remember each other?
sc465_spa_1	You should rest...\I'm sorry.
sc465_spa_2	I'm well-rested, thanks to you.\I'll repay you by winning our next battle.
sc465_spa_3	I'll train Nezha and make sure she pulls her weight.\Please don't hate her even if she has a tendency to misbehave.
sc465_spa_4	Master, may I have Nezha here with me?\She's always so exhausted...
sc465_spa_5	You've been such a generous master, I don't know\how to repay you. I am forever in your debt.
sc465_spa_max	Now, you'll be my master forever.
sc466_spa_1	Oooh, I didn't know there was a place like this. It looks nice.
sc466_spa_2	Whoa, look! This foam is so fluffy!\This is fun. I'd love to come here more often!
sc466_spa_3	Master, why didn't you bring me here sooner?\Were you keeping this place to yourself?
sc466_spa_4	Mm... My skin feels soft... I feel relaxed, too...\This is wonderful. Thanks, Master.
sc466_spa_5	So far, you've been the best master I've had. *Ahem!*\So, you'd better keep it up and not abandon me! Promise?
sc466_spa_max	Aaah... I feel fully rested now. Hehe!\Thanks, Master. You're the best demon in the world!
sc467_spa_1	Oh, I didn't expect such a gift!\I'll never forget this.
sc467_spa_2	I recommend this spa to my patients as well.\Flins and I come here often, actually.
sc467_spa_3	Would you like to join Flins and I for dinner later?\Hm? You don't feel comfortable around him? Oh...
sc467_spa_4	Flins must be watching me from somewhere,\ready to leap to my rescue at a moment's notice. Ha ha.
sc467_spa_5	You're just like Flins.\Especially how you can't be left alone for too long. Ha ha.
sc467_spa_max	I didn't help you just to repay you.\I did it because you're my friend.
sc468_spa_1	It's hot! I don't understand you guys.\Why do you like to bathe in such hot water?
sc468_spa_2	I feel comfortable when I'm with Nephthys.\It's not too bad to get close to another Child.
sc468_spa_3	Did you know? I don't have to read your mind to know\what you're thinking. Your face gives it away. It's funny.
sc468_spa_4	At first, I thought you were narrow-minded,\but now I know what a good master you are to your Childs. Thank you.
sc468_spa_5	I'll stop everyone who approaches you with evil intent.\So, move forward confidently.
sc468_spa_max	Don't worry, even if no one seems to know\how hard you work. Because I do.
sc469_spa_1	Nothing beats a hot bath\after a hard day's work.
sc469_spa_2	Do you know what the most important thing is for singing groups like us? It's a passion for music\and love for our fans!
sc469_spa_3	Blah, blah, blah! Did you call me? Just give me a moment.\I'm practicing my autograph on the water for when I'm famous.
sc469_spa_4	Master, wouldn't it be nice if I was the Infernal Realm's greatest singer\and you were Archfiend?
sc469_spa_5	Hard work pays off, Master.\How'd you like to become the world's greatest manager?
sc469_spa_max	Maybe I should aim for dominating the Infernal Realm with my songs,\and with you as my manager.
sc470_spa_1	I'm not afraid of the water anymore!
sc470_spa_2	Sometimes I wonder what was going through the minds\of the first humans who saw a hot spring\and decided to hop in.
sc470_spa_3	I've tried learning to swim.\But I can't... I can't swim so...\Um, never mind!
sc470_spa_4	It's good to work hard.\You can be better today than you were yesterday, and better tomorrow than you are today.
sc470_spa_5	I don't even want to imagine putting on a show\where you're not watching, Mr. Demon!
sc470_spa_max	I'm aiming to be one of the best pop stars,\even if it takes a while.\You'll help me, won't you?
sc471_spa_1	Wait, wait! You can't go past this point.\Don't wanna spoil the mystery.
sc471_spa_2	Pretty Sweet Devi Sexy! That sounds catchy, right?\How'd you like to be my Petite Devi?
sc471_spa_3	As usual, I'm going to stretch, warm up my voice, practice my dancing skills,\and then work on my charm—ah! How long have you been watching me?!
sc471_spa_4	How do pop stars stay popular? Mm, Aria would probably say\it's being unique and a having a pretty smile.
sc471_spa_5	Why don't you just join us? You could split your work with Maestro.\How about it?
sc471_spa_max	This may sound ridiculous,\but I want us to dominate the world with our songs. And I know if you're with us, we can do it.
sc472_spa_1	Ahh,\the hot spring's so warm and relaxing.\I could just melt away in here.
sc472_spa_2	You know, Neptune♥ always gets on my case\whenever I try to take a nap.\There's gotta be something I can do.\*sigh*
sc472_spa_3	Everyone in Planet Party\has been getting along swimmingly lately.\That's, at least in part, because of you.\So, thanks.
sc472_spa_4	Nowadays I almost forget I'm a demon.\Guess that's how powerful\the pull of the pop star is.\...Not that I'm complaining.
sc472_spa_5	I find it so charming\seeing all the cute little members improve.\On that note, though,\if anyone tries to get the best of them,\they'll have to deal with me.
sc472_spa_max	I get mixed feelings\whenever I think about going back to the Infernal Realm.\Seems I'm still a little hung up\on you and the Mortal Realm.
sc473_spa_1	So hot and relaxing! Delightful! What?\You look jealous.
sc473_spa_2	Why did you leave all of a sudden? Wait, let me guess.\Mm... You tried to run away from the Contest because you were scared, didn't you?
sc473_spa_3	I don't know if I deserve such a luxury.\What do I do to repay you? Hmm... Why do you look worried all of a sudden?
sc473_spa_4	You shouldn't bottle up your emotions like that.\Talk to me if you have a problem. I'm a good listener.
sc473_spa_5	I'm sorry I acted like a babe. I really want to\help you now. Will you accept my help?
sc473_spa_max	Forget your worries and count on me.\I'm your lucky charm!
sc474_spa_1	If we have no business,\leave me be.
sc474_spa_2	These scars? They're nothing.\You should see other blacksmiths\and how many scars they have.
sc474_spa_3	Why did I become a blacksmith?\I don't know. I haven't really thought about it.\That was so long ago...\Well, whys don't really matter, do they?
sc474_spa_4	Striking melted iron creates\a beautiful display of sparks. It's so artistic.\Hah, you don't get it, do you?
sc474_spa_5	You think demons can't be creators?\I think every living thing\has an ember inside it.\I can see yours.
sc474_spa_max	Don't kill the ember inside you.\Let it burn forever,\so it'll keep your brazier kindled.
sc475_spa_1	I'm so relaxed that I might fall asleep. If you see me floating in the water,\please get me out.
sc475_spa_2	I heard hot baths were good for your health,\so I once stayed in one until I nearly fainted. Haha!
sc475_spa_3	Some new potential rivals?\I'm not worried about competition. We have something no one else has.
sc475_spa_4	Sometimes you underestimate yourself.\You shouldn't; you're much greater than you think.
sc475_spa_5	I want to sing on a bigger stage.\Maybe you can help me with that.
sc475_spa_max	Lead us with confidence.\We trust you, Sir Demon.
sc476_spa_1	I hope you won't get angry even if I stay here all day.\Hah hah... I was just pulling your leg.
sc476_spa_2	Master, stop standing in the corner and come over here.\Let's have a chat and create pleasant memories.
sc476_spa_3	One day, I'd love to bring my and Metis's pactmakers here\and enjoy bathing together.
sc476_spa_4	Demon, are demons compatible with humans?\Then, how'd you like to go out with my pactmaker? Oh, don't run away!
sc476_spa_5	I don't know how tough it is to compete in the Archfiend Contest,\but I'll try my best to help you win it.
sc476_spa_max	Call me if you need me for anything.\I'll be there to help you.
sc479_spa_1	I've never wasted my time in a place like this.
sc479_spa_2	Do people really stay here for hours?\When do they train, then?
sc479_spa_3	What are you up to?\Why do you keep taking me on these nice spa trips?
sc479_spa_4	I've learned a few stretching techniques\to take advantage of hot baths.
sc479_spa_5	Perhaps I needed some time to relax like this.\Thank you for such a nice gift.
sc479_spa_max	You will be Archfiend. I'll make sure of it.\I refuse to settle for anything less than best.
sc480_spa_1	Whoa! I've never been to such a nice place!\Hey, want to come in and join me?
sc480_spa_2	Do we have to leave already? Aww...\Can't we stay for a little longer?
sc480_spa_3	Ah, I bought a bunch of bath salts to use on my spa days,\and I totally forgot about them. Could you bring them to me? Hee hee.
sc480_spa_4	You keep taking me on these nice spa trips.\You don't have any ulterior motives, do you? Hee hee.
sc480_spa_5	Hey, wait! You're not going to leave me alone here, are you?\Come on, stay with me for a little longer.
sc480_spa_max	You must be the best demon in the world.\How else would you know of this wonderful spa? Teehee!
sc481_spa_1	Ah, that hit the spot! I commend you this time.
sc481_spa_2	Hey, Carrot. Keep my grenade launcher close.\Even a hot spa isn't safe from enemy attack.
sc481_spa_3	Anywhere can become a battlefield.\A relaxing spa is no exception.
sc481_spa_4	Why do you hate it when your succubi ask you to make a pact?\Don't you want more comrades?
sc481_spa_5	You can always rely on me, Carrot. We're comrades.\I would die for you.
sc481_spa_max	Now that we're well-rested, let's go back to fighting!
sc482_spa_1	Why aren't there any fish in the hot spring? Isn't the hot spring water good for them as well?\...Excuse me? It'll cook them?
sc482_spa_2	Master, look! Two leaves fell onto the water,\and now they're dancing together!
sc482_spa_3	That sound... Was that Takuro's voice or did I just imagine it?\It must be my imagination. Please, tell me that's all it was.
sc482_spa_4	When you become Archfiend, can you do anything you want?\Then, I'd like you to make it rain ice cream instead of snow in winter.
sc482_spa_5	I'm not confident in a fight, but I won't give up,\no matter what. You shouldn't, either, Master.
sc482_spa_max	Take the lead, Master.\I'll bring up the rear.
sc483_spa_1	Wow. This outdoor bath is quite nice.
sc483_spa_2	Outdoor baths are wonderful\but you're a sitting duck for snipers.
sc483_spa_3	Demon.\Battle requires rest.\When you rest, rest well,\because battle knows no end.
sc483_spa_4	Do you know what you need to be a strong soldier?\Ingenuity, that's what.\That will be your key to victory.
sc483_spa_5	Benevolence is more important than military might or intellect.\There is promise in you.
sc483_spa_max	Shut up and follow me.\I'll make sure you win.
sc485_spa_1	Don't bother fussing about me much.\You won't get anything in return.
sc485_spa_2	Yuna seems glad to have met you.\I don't expect anything from you, though.
sc485_spa_3	Still here?\You're not going to have any fun hanging around me.
sc485_spa_4	I'm a puddle in the back of Yuna's mind.\Rotting, slowly but surely.
sc485_spa_5	My wish is for Yuna to be happy.\If that wish is granted, I won't be needed anymore.
sc485_spa_max	I thought you'd changed...\But I guess you're still the same.\Despite how much I changed...
sc486_spa_1	This hot spring's surprisingly lukewarm.\Can't it get any hotter?
sc486_spa_2	Hey, you.\What are you doing standing around in a daze?\Wash your grimy butt already.
sc486_spa_3	Not the time to be lazing about, you say?\Bahaha!\I actually don't mind that sass.
sc486_spa_4	Revenge? You little demon brats don't even know how to fight!\Bahaha!\Living long does have its perks.
sc486_spa_5	Can't believe a buncha greenhorns would do me in.\But ya know, it was a good experience.\Revenge is the source of magic power.
sc486_spa_max	Believe it or not, I think you've got a future.\Make it through this, ya hear?\I'll congratulate ya when the Archfiend Contest is over.
sc488_spa_1	Do you have anything I could eat while I soak in the bath?
sc488_spa_2	Don't talk to me. I'm thinking of something important.\Hm, should I go with fried chicken?\A burger sounds really good, too.\There's also pizza...
sc488_spa_3	Potatoes really are the most delicious thing in the world.\They're great fried or even boiled!
sc488_spa_4	What's so difficult?\If you wanna do something, just do it.
sc488_spa_5	Did you think I never noticed\how you sigh when you look at me?\I think about you too, you know.
sc488_spa_max	Don't order me around just 'cause you're my master.\Even I would help you out\if you just asked in a cute way!
sc489_spa_1	I've never seen such a small bath before...\Well, I suppose it doesn't matter.
sc489_spa_2	Ah... I'm so bored. Why don't you do something to amuse me?\I'll grant you a wish in return.
sc489_spa_3	I see you're always surrounded by friends. I envy you.\All of mine are weirdos.
sc489_spa_4	You think I've made you miserable? Hah hah. I'm sorry,\but you were born miserable. I simply reminded you.
sc489_spa_5	Demons feed on human desires.\That's probably why we can never be satisfied.
sc489_spa_max	How much longer am I going to torment you?\Let's see... Until you're sucked completely dry. Hah hah hah!
sc493_spa_1	There are so many strange things on Earth...\Hey, what are you doing? Turn around.
sc493_spa_2	We get to enjoy such luxury during times of war...\Incredible.
sc493_spa_3	I'm going to get myself one of these hot springs\when I go back to Putena. It's so relaxing.
sc493_spa_4	I'm tired of fighting, but I must protect my mother\and my hungry people. You have things to protect, too, don't you?
sc493_spa_5	I'll do my best to help you until I return to Putena.\You'll be Archfiend, and I'll reclaim my empire.
sc493_spa_max	Thank you. I won't forget this.\I swear on my royal title.
sc494_spa_1	Hmm ha hoo huh hmm! ♬ I can't stop humming.\This hot spring on Earth is so pleasant.
sc494_spa_2	There's a hot spring like this in Putena.\It even smells similar. I miss Putena...
sc494_spa_3	I still think of His Majesty every night.\I miss him so much, especially when I'm in a place like this.
sc494_spa_4	Has Messier been here before? This place is so warm.\I wish she were here with me.
sc494_spa_5	I'll miss this place when I go back to Putena.\Ho ho! And you, of course.
sc494_spa_max	Thank you. You took me under your wing when I had no place to go.\You're so kind.
sc495_spa_1	You said you were taking me somewhere nice\but you lied!\What are you trying to do?\Boil me alive to eat me?!
sc495_spa_2	Masteeer.\How long are you staying in there?\Staying in that scalding water for so long is weird.
sc495_spa_3	Heheh.\I got used to the hot springs, too.\Feel free to stay in a while longer, Master.
sc495_spa_4	Master, Silk and Poppy\found happiness thanks to you.\So, I'm going to make sure\you find it, too!
sc495_spa_5	Master, you're nothing like a demon.\Your heart is so soft.\Which is why I'm going\to keep it safe!\Heehee.
sc495_spa_max	Master, I'm really, really, really serious about this.\You tell me when you're in danger.\We'll run away together somewhere really far!\Okay?!
sc496_spa_1	Master!\What a fabulous pool!\What?!\You can't swim in here?
sc496_spa_2	Hot springs are so nice!\They warm up your body and mind.\There's something healing about them.
sc496_spa_3	These hot springs are too good\to keep to ourselves!\We gotta spread the word to lots of humans--\oh, we can't tell humans, can we?
sc496_spa_4	Hey, Master, why don't we travel the Mortal Realm together,\helping people along the way?\Hey, why are you covering your ears?
sc496_spa_5	Master, do you have a dream?\What is it?!\If you tell me...\then I can make it come true.
sc496_spa_max	Master, listen.\If you have trouble with anything,\come to me first. Okay?\I'll be there to lend a hand.
sc497_spa_1	When did you prepare such a nice event?\Alright, what do you want? What do you want to look like?
sc497_spa_2	I don't have time to waste in a place like this.\I've got a mountain of subjects to study.
sc497_spa_3	This is Heaven! Hah hah, I'm joking.\But I'd love to see the Heaven that you humans have imagined.
sc497_spa_4	I've read numerous alchemists' research journals.\All of them only hovered at the edges of truth.
sc497_spa_5	Methuselah bit me while I was distracted.\Hah hah! His fangs weren't as dull as I expected.
sc497_spa_max	We're blind snakes. That's why we pursue\our own tails. So twisted, isn't it?
sc498_spa_1	A hot spring?\Water seems a bit tepid, but hey, I'll take a break.
sc498_spa_2	An Archfiend Contest?\Sounds good for a warm-up.
sc498_spa_3	What's the matter, kid? Hopping in or not?
sc498_spa_4	I think I'm about done.\Are you getting out now, too?
sc498_spa_5	Gimme a break...\All right, fine. I'll tag along for now.
sc498_spa_max	Care for a ride?\You can hop in the sidecar.
sc499_spa_1	I've never been to a place that made me feel like this.
sc499_spa_2	Warm... This is very comfortable.
sc499_spa_3	People need rest. Let's rest together.
sc499_spa_4	Tell me. Why do you want to become the Archfiend?
sc499_spa_5	You were kind to tell me about this place.\Thank you. I have enjoyed it.
sc499_spa_max	Davi, Mona, and Lisa are here, too.\I'm lonely but I'm not lonely.
sc500_spa_1	It's not so bad taking a nice break like this\every once in a while.
sc500_spa_2	A woman's hair is her life. She has to take good care of it.
sc500_spa_3	Do you plan to stay there staring the whole time? You'll wish you hadn't.
sc500_spa_4	You want to know how I rate the place?\It's passable, in my book.
sc500_spa_5	What happened? Stay in too long?\Your face is redder than a tomato.
sc500_spa_max	Relaxing here for a bit might not be so bad...\At least until I get back home.
sc501_spa_1	You sure this is hot enough?\Let me heat it up some more with my fire.
sc501_spa_2	Everyone tries so hard to achieve Nirvana that they become blind.\Don't they know Paradise is to be found on Earth, not in Heaven?
sc501_spa_3	Nothing lasts forever,\so enjoy it while you can.
sc501_spa_4	So, who do you think you really are?\Who lies hidden beneath your skin?
sc501_spa_5	Do you know where you came from and where you're going?\You exist to find the answers.
sc501_spa_max	Set aside anger. Don't be overjoyed or great in sadness.\Show yourself some kindness.
sc502_spa_1	Whew, thank you.\I feel as if I'm on vacation.
sc502_spa_2	I think the Teacher is here, too. Could you find her for me?\I need a bit of rest in the meantime...
sc502_spa_3	If I keep praying and training, I'll become at least\half as good as my teacher, right? That's good enough for me.
sc502_spa_4	There's a time for everything. Flowers bloom and fall\as the seasons change. You'll bloom one day, too.
sc502_spa_5	Iron rusts from disuse, and stagnant water loses its purity.\Don't hesitate to keep moving forward.
sc502_spa_max	Let me know if you need my help.\I can do my part.
sc503_spa_1	This is a land of rest for body and mind.\It's as if I were in the Celestial Realm's paradise.
sc503_spa_2	I sense the energy descending the mountains.\The energy within me flows smoothly\when I soak in this hot spring.
sc503_spa_3	Do you want to contain the earth's energy for longer?\Heh heh...\In that case, give me a call.
sc503_spa_4	The cosmic dual forces must be in harmony\to bring in positive energy.\We can find harmony\if you enter the hot springs with me.
sc503_spa_5	I'm concerned by the wind's disturbance\of the soil's energy.\Say the word and I'll block it.
sc503_spa_max	Our meeting must have been ordained by fate.\Should you become Archfiend,\I will relay Rinko's data.
sc504_spa_1	Hold on a second!\Have you been hogging this awesome place\this whole time?
sc504_spa_2	It's kinda lukewarm, don't you think?\Could you make it hotter for me?\Umm... Hello?\You were ignoring me 'cause I'm weak, weren't you?
sc504_spa_3	What human told you about this hot spring?\You can tell me.
sc504_spa_4	You should just run away\if you don't wanna deal with the Archfiend Contest.\Heck of a sense of duty for a demon.
sc504_spa_5	This is the first time I befriend a demon.\I wonder how things might've been\if we'd met before I came to the Mortal Realm.
sc504_spa_max	You've got a delicate heart,\just like me.\I really hope a gentle demon like you\becomes Archfiend.
sc505_spa_1	Ah! Following up a race with a hot bath...\This is perfect!
sc505_spa_2	I see athletic-looking Childs here and there, Master.\How about we gather them and hold a sports day?
sc505_spa_3	Pop quiz, master! The cheetah is the fastest animal.\But who's the fastest Child?
sc505_spa_4	Master, so, when are you going to become Archfiend? What? Never? Don't say that!
sc505_spa_5	I really love running. The thing I love second\most is enjoying beautiful scenery. With you.
sc505_spa_max	With you, I can go running anywhere, to the ends of the Infernal Realm...\or the universe! I know I can!
sc506_spa_1	You're such a good master,\bringing me to a hot spring like this.
sc506_spa_2	I like running because I can enjoy the beautiful scenery\and feel nature through my whole body as I do it.
sc506_spa_3	Demon, aren't you interested in a group competition?\Sometimes, I want to run with lots of other Childs.
sc506_spa_4	Demon, I want you to be Archfiend, but you don't look like you're interested in that.\Well, I guess I'll have to work hard for both of us. Hehe!
sc506_spa_5	I like when you act as the ref. It feels as if you're welcoming me every time I cross the finishing line.
sc506_spa_max	You just walk the path you believe in.\I'll pave it for you.
sc507_spa_1	What's this?\Did you prepare this hot spring just for me?\'Cause you know, I prefer booze.
sc507_spa_2	Ooh...\This actually feels pretty nice.\But it's made me real thirsty.\If only I had some cold sparkling water...
sc507_spa_3	Aah... So nice.\I'm getting a little dizzy.\Is this what being drunk feels like?
sc507_spa_4	I've grown accustomed to the hot springs.\They're way better than that boring shrine.\Hah hah!
sc507_spa_5	Phew. I'm so refreshed.\I bet some booze would taste amazing right now.\Wanna grab a drink?
sc507_spa_max	My body got so stiff\stuck in the shrine.\But I feel a lot better now.\Thanks!
sc508_spa_1	What is this?\I've never seen a place like this.
sc508_spa_2	Who are you supposed to be?\Why are you being nice to me?
sc508_spa_3	A demon's a demon's a demon.\My mission is to kill every last one of them.\No exceptions.
sc508_spa_4	Becoming friendly with a demon?\If that's a joke, it's a terrible one.
sc508_spa_5	Do not torment the villagers.\If you can abide by that...\I'll stop lumping you in\with all the other demons.
sc508_spa_max	The hot spring is such a mysterious place.\Even if you weren't around,\I'd still protect this place.
sc509_spa_1	Vlad told me a funny story.\Um... It was one where everyone\died at the end.
sc509_spa_2	Deucalion was nothing but a pile of secrets.\Yet strangely enough,\I never doubted him.
sc509_spa_3	It's been so long since I was outside the castle,\and the world seems so different.\I look forward to the experiences awaiting me.
sc509_spa_4	The Elixir is a potion of eternal youth,\and also proof of a promise\that will never be broken.
sc509_spa_5	My days in the Suicide Corps feel like lifetimes ago.\But meeting you,\I feel as if I have returned to that time.
sc509_spa_max	I'm truly glad I met you.\Thank you for finding me\when I was lost to the passage of time.
sc510_spa_1	Expecting a gift or something?\Hate to break it to ya, but I'm broke.
sc510_spa_2	Does the hot spring seem a bit on the scorching side?\Hey, get me an ice cold beer.
sc510_spa_3	What's with that face?\You look like you're dead.
sc510_spa_4	You want me to tell you I'm grateful?\Easy enough... Thanks.
sc510_spa_5	If you plan to make it to the end, gird yourself.\If you go in half-heartedly,\you'll be extremely lucky not to die.
sc510_spa_max	Vampires, demons, humans...\They're all the same to me,\so don't dwell too much on it.
sc511_spa_1	Did you set this up for me?
sc511_spa_2	This isn't a dangerous place, right?\Oh, it's not that I don't trust you,\Mr. Demon.
sc511_spa_3	Hmm... This is really refreshing and everything, but...\I wonder if it's okay for me to rest here.
sc511_spa_4	I wish Turan were here, too...\Oh gosh, I hope it doesn't sound\like I'm complaining.
sc511_spa_5	Is it okay for me to be soaking in these hot springs?\Thank you so much for bringing me here.
sc511_spa_max	Turan's waiting for me, so I should get going.\Sorry.
sc512_spa_1	Oh wow, this is such a nice place.\Do humans come here, too?
sc512_spa_2	Aaah... It's making me so wonderfully warm.\I wish he could be at ease here, too.
sc512_spa_3	I don't need him to share my feelings.\I'm happy just getting to see him.
sc512_spa_4	He's my first love. And he is a human, but...\I still love him with all of my heart.
sc512_spa_5	Philotes has always been a source of courage.\It may be thanks to her\that I learned what love is.
sc512_spa_max	My friend's waiting for me.\I'll be right back!
sc513_spa_1	If you offer this place up unto me,\I shall give you a reward.
sc513_spa_2	Humans can be quite useful.\But their idiocy makes them so unwieldy.
sc513_spa_3	Bear in mind,\those who defy me receive due punishment.
sc513_spa_4	Come here.\I wish to take a better look at your face.
sc513_spa_5	Offer all you have up to me.\I will become your light.
sc513_spa_max	Let me bless you.\What is it you wish for?\I am almighty Akrasia.\All is within my capabilities.
sc514_spa_1	I didn't know there was an Infernal Realm Spa in the Mortal Realm!\That gets rid of any reason to go back to the Infernal Realm, doesn't it?
sc514_spa_2	So many things are inconvenient without Archimago.\Sure, he gives me sass, but he gets the job done.
sc514_spa_3	You're really weird, you know that?\Why don't you take advantage of humans?\Don't tell me you get pangs of conscience!
sc514_spa_4	I'd like to be Archfiend if I could.\But I'm not confident enough. You're the same, right?\Say, wanna come live in my kingdom?
sc514_spa_5	What's wrong with demons becoming gods?\We've been liars from the start.\You should give it a try. It's a riot.
sc514_spa_max	The Infernal Realm is so lame. Everyone looks down on you.\You like it better in the Mortal Realm, too, right?\We're pretty similar, you and I!
sc517_spa_1	You want to hop in with me?\Aw heck, why not? But only 'cause you're the Master.
sc517_spa_2	If you're the reason I was born,\does that make you my daddy?\You being a dad is so stinkin' funny!
sc517_spa_3	You really have no idea\just how much I like you, huh?
sc517_spa_4	You don't wanna fight? You're just a wimp, aren't you?\Well, it's fine. You've got Grendel on your side!
sc517_spa_5	My wish is to have a fun life.\You say demons can't grant wishes,\but I feel like mine's come true thanks to you.
sc517_spa_max	Let's make our lives\super fun together, Master.\And absolutely no running off, you got it?
sc520_spa_1	This is so wonderful I could forget all my cares.
sc520_spa_2	Nice and warm.
sc520_spa_3	This place is better than I expected.
sc520_spa_4	Knowing you, I'm surprised how nice this is.
sc520_spa_5	I'll take hanging out here\over battling against tedious fates.
sc520_spa_max	I wanna come here with Sarasu and Pandora.
sc521_spa_1	This isn't my style.
sc521_spa_2	Hrm... Guess I nodded off.
sc521_spa_3	A Child's duty?\What is the duty of a master, then?\I feel like Dalia doesn't have\any awareness of that.
sc521_spa_4	I don't recall asking you to be nice to me.\I'm not saying I don't like it here, though.
sc521_spa_5	To tell the truth, both you and Dalia are pathetic.\That said, you're easier to be around.
sc521_spa_max	I'll try my best in my own way\as long as we're together.\Consider that the bare minimum courtesy.
sc522_spa_1	I followed you here on the assumption\that I was deceived.\So, let's see how "amazing" of a place this actually is.
sc522_spa_2	I tried to list what Zegati can do.\Number one: comedian. Number two: model.\As for number three...
sc522_spa_3	I've decided.\I'm going to buy out the Infernal Realm Spa!
sc522_spa_4	Zegati and I are going to live happily together\in the Infernal Realm when the Archfiend Contest ends.\It's our destiny.
sc522_spa_5	Consider yourself lucky you met me.\I'm about to carve out your destiny for you.
sc522_spa_max	You should be nice to me, you know.\I hold your destiny in the palm of my hand.
sc523_spa_1	My skin feels so soft.\This hot spring in the Infernal Realm isn't too bad.
sc523_spa_2	A hot bath on Christmas. Not a bad combination.
sc523_spa_3	You act as if you're special because you have the Christmas Box.\Well, enjoy the feeling while you can.
sc523_spa_4	Santa usually doesn't give presents to demons,\but maybe a cute demon might get it.
sc523_spa_5	Where did you hide the Christmas Box, mm?\Maybe you'd tell me if I tickle you. Tickle, tickle.
sc523_spa_max	Santa gives presents to good kids.\Now, kiddo. What do you want for Christmas?
sc524_spa_1	Where's Nicole?\There's no way she'd miss out on such a great opportunity.
sc524_spa_2	I don't understand Nicole. You're a demon. Why didn't she\get rid of you already? How important is her sleigh-puller to her?
sc524_spa_3	Santa Claus exists. He doesn't look like what most people think,\though. You've seen her.
sc524_spa_4	I'm going back home as soon as I get the Christmas Box back.\I'll purge you after that.
sc524_spa_5	You didn't forget I'm an exorcist, did you?\Then, why are you being so nice to me?
sc524_spa_max	I don't trust demons,\but if you repent, I'll pray to God for you.
sc525_spa_1	A-an open-air hot bath in the middle of winter...\I-I'm glad I've joined the Contest.
sc525_spa_2	Wh-where is my fated partner...?
sc525_spa_3	I-I'd like my partner to be s-smart.\B-because I'm a bit stupid, you know. J-just a little bit...
sc525_spa_4	T-to tell you the truth, I n-never wanted to join the Contest.\B-but I didn't want to be left alone i-in the Infernal Realm, either.
sc525_spa_5	You're lucky that you met me.\That's right, I'm your miracle on Christmas. Hah hah hah!
sc525_spa_max	I-I came from a cold, wintry land. I-I thought everywhere\in the Mortal Realm was so cold... N-not this place.
sc526_spa_1	It looks super hot...\You go in first.\What? You wanna go in together?\Hrmmm... I don't do well with heat.
sc526_spa_2	Mmm, the water's perfect.\Hey, fetch me a towel.
sc526_spa_3	I've been in this hot water for a while so I'm burning up.\Fetch me some cold tea and something to munch on.
sc526_spa_4	Heh heh, what do you say?\Am I grown or what?\Look how long I've stayed\in the hot water!
sc526_spa_5	This hot spring is seriously the best.\I feel so energized!\I wonder if there's one like this in the Infernal Realm.
sc526_spa_max	Hey, do you want to meet my Daddy?\You want to be part of the family, don't you?
sc527_spa_1	I had no idea there was such a nice place out there.\Wanna take a dip with me?
sc527_spa_2	Teehee...\You're more assertive than I gave you credit for.\So, do you want to take a break with me?
sc527_spa_3	I'm with you, so...\I can fully relax, body and mind.
sc527_spa_4	Heehee...\You love me, don't you?\I'm not big on the persistent type, though...
sc527_spa_5	If you want me to...\I could become your destined Child.\But only if you don't tell Mistress Rani, okay?
sc527_spa_max	Ah, I'm so happy.\To think you'd shower me with so much love.\I suppose I'll have to offer you my love, as well. ♥
sc529_spa_1	Wow, it's so nice here! I feel like I'm flying!\I can't believe you didn't bring me here sooner.
sc529_spa_2	All my worries melt away.\What? I'm human. I have worries.
sc529_spa_3	Next time, I'd like to bring Hathor with me.\Do you think she'd like a place like this? She would, wouldn't she?
sc529_spa_4	Why don't you join me? It's so nice!\Come on!
sc529_spa_5	It's kind of nice to be listened to, even if you talk a lot.\Um, you weren't just pretending to listen, were you?
sc529_spa_max	Can't we talk some more?\What? Haven't we talked enough? Well, I just enjoy talking to you.
sc530_spa_1	Ahh... It's so warm...\You know, there are hot springs like these in the ocean, too.\Want to go there with me?
sc530_spa_2	What?\I'm not spacing out...\Honest.
sc530_spa_3	Hey, um...\This is my first time at a hot spring, so...\Can you teach me how to properly enjoy it?
sc530_spa_4	So, I have to get in up to my shoulders...\Am I doing it right?
sc530_spa_5	Won't you get in with me?\It feels positively amazing!
sc530_spa_max	Hot springs are wonderful.\Breaks like these are nice.
sc537_spa_1	As far as paradises go, this one's not bad.\Aaah, that feels good... ♪
sc537_spa_2	If the sea is a cool paradise, I guess this is a warm one.
sc537_spa_3	Maybe I'll make this my second paradise.
sc537_spa_4	Yo-ho, yo-ho ♪\Won't you get in with me?\I would rather enjoy it alone,\but just this once I'll let it slide.
sc537_spa_5	*sigh*\I could slip into the big sleep like this...\Ah! No, no, no!\I have to find my personal paradise!
sc537_spa_max	Thanks for showing me\there are different kinds of paradise.\Next destination, the sea!
sc538_spa_1	You're a rather curious person\to bring a mere servant such as myself\to a place like this.
sc538_spa_2	You want to know if it's uncomfortable being inside a Holy Relic?\Hmm...\I can't say It's felt that way.
sc538_spa_3	Why are you standing there staring at me?\Have you, perhaps...\grown interested in me?
sc538_spa_4	I am your servant.\I will do as you desire, whatever it may be.
sc538_spa_5	Do you believe I say that jokingly?\How unfortunate.\If it wasn't a joke...\What would you do?
sc538_spa_max	As your servant, I will be by your side as long as I live.
sc539_spa_1	Hmpf, I'm busy.\Of course, I can't be in a place like this.
sc539_spa_2	Hmpf! Did you think such a place would please me?\I suppose it's the thought that counts.
sc539_spa_3	I don't think I mind being in the hot water...\But don't get me wrong. I'm still upset with you!
sc539_spa_4	Ho ho. Alright, do you want to apologize to me?\This is nowhere near enough, though.
sc539_spa_5	I'll stay here a while longer for you.\Consider that an honor.
sc539_spa_max	You should join I mean, never mind!\I'll have this place all to myself!
sc545_spa_1	Oh my, are you trying to peep? I don't really mind, but... I might get hyped up.
sc545_spa_2	I have tons of work to do. I'm not sure if I have time to relax like this... Oh, whatever! I'm taking a break today.
sc545_spa_3	Is it your day off, too? Then... Then it's time for an exclusive interview! Would you like to tell me your story?
sc545_spa_4	I'm dying to know how you have been doing recently. You can tell me all your private and secret stories. This is between you and me.
sc545_spa_5	Lastly, how about... we share each other's private story? You tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine. I'm sure it will get high TV ratings. What do you say?
sc545_spa_max	Ho ho, that was some interview, wasn't it? It's not bad, having a time like this.
sc550_spa_1	This hot spring's a little drab, don't you think?\Why don't we put up some Christmas decorations?
sc550_spa_2	Wouldn't a snowman look totally adorable in here?\Oh, wait... It'd melt right away, huh?
sc550_spa_3	Why do I like Christmas so much?\Why wouldn't I? It's my birthday!
sc550_spa_4	I think you'll change your mind\if you spend Christmas with me.\I guarantee you'll have fun!
sc550_spa_5	Why not throw a Christmas party\while we're here?\A cozy Christmas sounds fun, doesn't it?
sc550_spa_max	Thank you for the gift that was this special time!\I'll never forget this day!
sc552_spa_1	I have a hard time staying still.
sc552_spa_2	You wish I'd take it easy sometimes?\Is that so?\Maybe I will.
sc552_spa_3	If I'm getting out eventually,\does it make a difference if I do it now versus later?\Okay, fine, I'll sit still.\You're so strict, you know that?
sc552_spa_4	Since it's come to this, I'm going to enjoy the hot springs more than anyone.\I know I'll be happier\if I'm the number one joyful here.
sc552_spa_5	I'm always in a hurry,\so this whole thing is a new experience.\And, well... What I'm saying is,\it's not that bad.
sc552_spa_max	You know how in the Mortal Realm they say\even chance meetings\are the result of karma?\Does that mean we'll connect like that?
sm003_spa_1	The spark of anger will never die...
sm003_spa_2	I'm not an idiot. You're trying to use me. I don't trust you one bit!
sm003_spa_3	I will protect Squeaky. Squeaky is my friend—my one and only family.
sm003_spa_max	Demon...be careful. If anything happens to you, you can't make another pact with Squeaky.
sm004_spa_1	The spark of anger will never die...
sm004_spa_2	I'm not an idiot. You're trying to use me. I don't trust you one bit!
sm004_spa_3	I will protect Squeaky. Squeaky is my friend—my one and only family.
sm004_spa_max	Demon...be careful. If anything happens to you, you can't make another pact with Squeaky.
sm007_spa_1	Hey, come on in, Demon! It's not hot at all. Hahaha.
sm007_spa_2	Why d'you follow me around, Demon? Do you think I'm gonna cause trouble? Even if I did, would you be able to stop me?
sm007_spa_3	I really like you, Demon. You always have the same reaction whenever I tease you! It's really funny! Mwahaha!
sm007_spa_max	I keep fooling you every single time, so why do you keep trusting me?
sm036_spa_1	Here we are at a hot spring, and you don't even plan to peep? You're so boring...
sm036_spa_2	You want to know what I wish for? It's no fun if I just tell you. Here, I'll give you a hint instead: it's a desire every being holds and yet no one knows about it. That's all I'll say.
sm036_spa_3	I want to understand you better, Demon. The more I learn about you, the more fascinating you are.
sm036_spa_max	Demons, humans... They all hate me, yet they always seek me out when they need me—even though I never put on airs or anything.
sm037_spa_1	Kee-kee-kee... Don't worry, I won't play any tricks. At least, not today...
sm037_spa_2	I don't need your meddling, Demon. Just stand there and watch the prank I'm about to pull off. Heh heh heh.
sm037_spa_3	Do you have any idea just how gloomy and irritating human hearts are? They're so oppressively boring that it makes me wanna die! I'm so glad I became a Child. Heh heh heh.
sm037_spa_max	I'll tell you how to dive deep into humans' desires. First off...you've gotta know what your own desire is. Hee hee hee...
sm038_spa_1	Fine.
sm038_spa_2	The one who made me...was not you, Demon. It was...inner desire.
sm038_spa_3	How long...have you been there? You're so quiet. What a gloomy person you are.
sm038_spa_4	Fighting is tiring. But...you cannot win against desire.
sm038_spa_5	I will find what you desire. I will forge a path.
sm038_spa_max	I will happily...help you. That is...my purpose.
sm039_spa_1	Rrrgh...
sm039_spa_2	I'm gonna kill you, you stupid master! And once you're dead, I'll kill you again!
sm039_spa_3	I hate you, you big dummy! But...birdie likes you. Why?
sm039_spa_max	I...don't really understand what Childs are. If you teach me...I'll study as hard as I can.
sm040_spa_1	I suppose the occasional moment of respite isn't so bad.
sm040_spa_2	You want to know the truth of this world? Then first empty your heart, be humble, and bow your head before the truth.
sm040_spa_3	You live a painful life, Demon. Do not fight it. Just accept it. Then you'll be saved from your pain.
sm040_spa_max	You're worried about the uncertain future? Haha... My young demon, simply face it and walk forward. Then you will open the path for yourself.
sm045_spa_1	How dare you peep on me?! You'd better own up to it!
sm045_spa_2	Where's that woman hiding?! Who am I looking for, you ask? Mona!—the one who made my pactmaker unhappy! I'm gonna find her and beat her to a bloody pulp!
sm045_spa_3	Come now... Just give in and accept me already. I'm the only one who truly loves you.
sm045_spa_max	I love you. I really love you. I'll love you until the day I die! Wait a sec... Aren't I already basically dead? Then I guess that means my love is never-ending!
sm049_spa_1	Click, clack...
sm049_spa_2	Foolish demon. Do you know what one plus one is? How about two times two? ...You don't know that either, do you?
sm049_spa_3	You think I'M ugly? Look who's talking!
sm049_spa_4	I am perfect. I am the best. No one can outdo me. No one. Hee hee hee...
sm049_spa_max	It's no use trying to think about it. You're too stupid. My calculations are so perfect that no one can find any fault with them. Bwa ha ha.
sm050_spa_1	Those who disturb me during my time of rest will be swiftly beheaded...
sm050_spa_2	I don't plan to lose on purpose, but I hate winning fights. It wastes a perfect opportunity to die, after all.
sm050_spa_3	All that draws breath is sent rushing towards death the moment it is born. Do not obsess over life—give your head to me.
sm050_spa_4	How about I kill you and you kill me? Isn't that the perfect plan?
sm050_spa_max	They say to enjoy life while you are alive, because death sneaks up on you. When that time comes, I'll guide you.
sm051_spa_1	Ugh... My body is melting away...
sm051_spa_2	Grrrr... The god of death approaches. Hurry, reaper! Kill me!
sm051_spa_3	Graaah! I will die! Die! Don't get in my way!
sm051_spa_4	If you interfere with my death, I'll broil you alive first...in the flames of hell.
sm051_spa_5	Death...comes for everyone. Why have I not died yet?
sm051_spa_max	Since the moment I was born, death has been closing in on me. But I cannot just wait for it to come. Ugh... Kill me! Kill me already!
sm052_spa_1	I'm hungry. I should go hunting soon.
sm052_spa_2	You say you're not gonna be the Archfiend? How dare you interfere with Lisa's plan!
sm052_spa_3	Frej... I don't care what happens to him. In fact, I hope he dies.
sm052_spa_max	Lisa alone is my path—my light. She's the sole reason for my existence.
sm053_spa_1	I... I can't drink anymore...
sm053_spa_2	Grrr... I like cats...\I hate you...\No, I like cats...\Cat, cat, demon?
sm053_spa_3	No cat... Looking.\You, find it.\Small and cute...\Huh? Cat? I eat everything!
sm053_spa_4	I like demon, he give me yummy treats...\I return the favor...\Give to me my daily bread...
sm053_spa_max	Sayoko...in my dreams...\You, too... I'm hungry...\Feed me more...then everything\I remember...
sm054_spa_1	Hot... I'm going to die. I...melt.
sm054_spa_2	Who am I? Tell me...
sm054_spa_3	Demon? What is demon? Augh! It hurts!
sm054_spa_4	I'm thirsty! It burns!
sm054_spa_max	I am Gomorrah. Gomorrah...
sm056_spa_1	Hm? Wh-What is it? Did you get water where you shouldn't have, or something?
sm056_spa_2	Who wants to get eaten by me? I'm starving!
sm056_spa_3	You fight so you don't die? Hahaha! That's absurd! Fighting is all about killing people!
sm056_spa_4	Idiot. If someone hurts you, you pay them back! How long are you just gonna do whatever you want?
sm056_spa_5	Weaklings are meant to be cut down! Keep only the strong by your side.
sm056_spa_max	Devour everything! And make every last thing yours!
sm057_spa_1	You followed me all the way here?
sm057_spa_2	You're curious about my appearance? You're as fond as ever of asking dull questions, I see.
sm057_spa_3	*sigh* You're so noisy. Could you shut your mouth and be quiet for two seconds? ...No? I'll just kill you, then.
sm057_spa_4	You say you chose me? If that is what you wish to think, then go ahead. Annoying demon.
sm057_spa_5	I can't believe I went along with what you said. There must be something wrong with me.
sm057_spa_max	Shut your mouth and sit still until I address you.
sm059_spa_1	I am...not waterproof...
sm059_spa_2	I do not think. It is my duty to carry out any order I am given.
sm059_spa_3	My driving force is my obsession with victory. I was designed to be the perfect fighting machine. I am your weapon, Master.
sm059_spa_max	The battlefield is a dangerous and ruthless place. It is more suited for me than you, Master.
sm063_spa_1	This was very thoughtful of you... I imagine resting here should do the trick.
sm063_spa_2	You seem to be in good spirits, Master. You're getting a bit carried away, so I will administer an emergency tranquilizer.
sm063_spa_3	You say you're fine today? Don't be ridiculous. You are a natural-born patient. Now stop complaining and let me give you a shot.
sm063_spa_max	Master, you seem pale again today. This must be...a sickness of the heart. I cannot cure such a sickness.
sm077_spa_1	*glub* *glub*
sm077_spa_2	Hello, Master. Oh, wait a moment! I wanted to talk a little longer with— *ahem* Well, well, well. If it isn't the stupid demon. How're ya doing? I hate it when you're doing well!
sm077_spa_3	Hey, idiot demon! How many times do I gotta tell ya? I'M the real Moa!
sm077_spa_4	Master... Actually, I've been keeping a secret. It's that...I'm only mimicking Kind Moa! Ahahaha!
sm077_spa_5	Master, have you memorized each of the Moa yet? There are seven in total. Hmmm? You can only remember half of them?
sm077_spa_max	You must understand, Master. All of us want to be Moa.
sm124_spa_1	I'm suddenly overwhelmed...by drowsiness...
sm124_spa_2	Let us escape from the complications of society and relax for a while.
sm124_spa_3	I'm glad I met you. The fact that my feelings for you deepen every time we meet speaks of a very special bond indeed.
sm124_spa_max	I have only one thing I want to say to you: walk your own path. No matter where you go, I will always be behind you.
sm125_spa_1	I'm suddenly overwhelmed...by drowsiness...
sm125_spa_2	Let us escape from the complications of society and relax for a while.

sm128_spa_1	I'm suddenly overwhelmed...by drowsiness...
sm128_spa_2	Let us escape from the complications of society and relax for a while.
sm128_spa_3	I'm glad I met you. The fact that my feelings for you deepen every time we meet speaks of a very special bond indeed.
sm128_spa_max	I have only one thing I want to say to you: walk your own path. No matter where you go, I will always be behind you.
sm136_spa_1	Would you mind taking this off of me?
sm136_spa_2	Have you heard from my pactmaker? It seems she's doing better than before. I'm glad I worked so hard to protect her.
sm136_spa_3	No matter how rough the fights are or how tired you get, don't ever give up. I will protect you.
sm136_spa_4	I like you because you're honest and more affectionate than other people.
sm136_spa_max	My body's restrained, but I'm plenty free. It's all thanks to you.
sm137_spa_1	Allow me to scrub you clean.
sm137_spa_2	I am not tired. I find strength in being your Child. I can and will do anything for your sake, Master.
sm137_spa_3	You wish to become friends with me? But we already are, Master.
sm137_spa_max	I...l-l-love you, Master. It's true.
sm141_spa_1	Don't look at me like that. It's embarrassing...
sm141_spa_2	The idea of a scraggly little runt like you becoming Archfiend is just... Ahaha! Owww! Why'd you hit me?!
sm141_spa_3	I got a letter from Davi. Aren't you jealous? And it's not just any letter, either. It's a LUCKY letter!
sm141_spa_4	Sometimes I have nightmares. I don't remember them after I wake up, but I still end up feeling spooked for a while. I hate that.
sm141_spa_max	I'm not scared anymore! Why? Because I've got you by my side! You may be an idiot, but it's better than having no one at all. I still won't call you "Master," though.
sm142_spa_1	Just how long do you plan on being here?
sm142_spa_2	You're an eyesore. Don't get in my way. Go play in traffic or something.
sm142_spa_3	Revenge is best served scorching hot. Burn your enemies to a crisp, then the surrounding area, and finally yourself, until everything is ash.
sm142_spa_max	When your revenge is complete, all that's left is emptiness. I have a feeling you might be able to fill the void inside me, though.
sm143_spa_1	Just how long do you plan on being here?
sm143_spa_2	You're an eyesore. Don't get in my way. Go play in traffic or something.
sm143_spa_3	Revenge is best served scorching hot. Burn your enemies to a crisp, then the surrounding area, and finally yourself, until everything is ash.
sm143_spa_max	When your revenge is complete, all that's left is emptiness. I have a feeling you might be able to fill the void inside me, though.

sm150_spa_1	*hic* Oops, I think I'm a little tipsy... *hic*
sm150_spa_2	I've loved you from the moment I met you, Master!
sm150_spa_3	Maaaster... Maaaster... I wanna be your little puppy!
sm150_spa_4	I bragged about you to the other Childs! And they all laughed! They must love you so much!
sm150_spa_max	You're the only who's nice to me, Master! You trust me, right? Hee hee!
sm151_spa_1	Time for me...to hibernate...
sm151_spa_2	Once upon a time in a faraway land, a red demon and blue demon met and got married. The two loved each other for many moons...and then they killed and ate each other! Gahahaha!
sm151_spa_3	I've got no hooome ♪ I'm all alone. It's fun! Yeah! Fun! Yahoo!
sm151_spa_max	There's a big, round moon floating in the sky. Hey, let's climb a mountain! I'll make sure the bunnies hiding on the moon live happily ever after!
sm152_spa_1	I'm in the middle of an upgrade.\It's gonna be good times when I'm done...
sm152_spa_2	Hey, you're ready today, right? Let's have a proper fight! ...What, you have a stomachache again?
sm152_spa_3	I still can't believe I lost to that demon guy, but I accept it. I'll just fight him again and score a victory this time! Hahaha!
sm152_spa_max	There's no opponent more difficult to overcome than your inner saboteur. If you can win against yourself, you can beat anything!
sm153_spa_1	Tonight's dream should be a good one...
sm153_spa_2	Do not listen to what your opponent says. Focus only on the fight.
sm153_spa_3	Having become your Child, I am now satisfied. I've realized that even though you are useless, all will be well as long as I take matters into my own forelegs.
sm153_spa_max	No matter how many times I beat back the nightmares, they always return. If you also have such nightmares, feel free to call me. I will fight them until I die.
sm154_spa_1	All who interrupt my rest!\You are evil incarnate.
sm154_spa_2	Utilize my power to become the Archfiend?\Preposterous.\My strength is to be used to judge evil.
sm154_spa_3	I was born from my pactmaker's justice.\Her justice is also mine.
sm154_spa_4	I cannot abide by two senses of justice.\Demon, you cannot become my justice.
sm154_spa_max	Demon.\I shall show you true justice.
sm189_spa_1	I'm gonna sparkle like nobody's business!
sm189_spa_2	Every day I sharpen my teeth so that no one can steal my treasure!
sm189_spa_3	Why do you keep coming to see me? Oh, I know! You want my treasure too, don't you? If that's not it, then...maybe you wanna be my friend?
sm189_spa_max	Leave all your precious treasures to me! I'll guard 'em!
sm190_spa_1	From now on, this hot spring is mine...
sm190_spa_2	I should devote myself to my master, you say? I serve nothing but my own desires!
sm190_spa_3	I'll make you the Archfiend. In exchange, you better hand over that Archfiend crown to me!
sm190_spa_max	People who've got stuff end up getting more stuff, but people who've got nothing only get stolen from. That's only natural. So, which do you choose?
sm191_spa_1	Watch your footing...
sm191_spa_2	There's no point in criticizing swindlers. People like that are probably being fooled like total suckers themselves. Mwahaha…
sm191_spa_3	You wanna know what I really think? Tough to say. Swindlers fool themselves, so even I don't know how to pin down my thoughts on 'em.
sm191_spa_4	If you don't wanna get swindled like some kinda sucker, then you better learn how to fool others.
sm191_spa_max	Is it that important to discern truth from lies? Just trust what I say. Then that'll be the truth. Mwahaha...
sm192_spa_1	For one aiming to become Archfiend,\you certainly lack decorum.
sm192_spa_2	Insolent cur! How dare you scold me! I will prevent you from ever opening that impertinent mouth of yours again!
sm192_spa_3	Why do you not listen to me? ...You say I am sulking?! You dare to claim that I, of all people, would stoop to sulking?!

sm199_spa_3	Why do you not listen to me? ...You say I am sulking?! You dare to claim that I, of all people, would stoop to sulking?!
sm199_spa_max	I am the most compassionate, impartial leader to have ever existed. ...Hm?! Who just snickered?! Show yourself, coward!
sm200_spa_1	You should've told me about this wonderful place sooner.
sm200_spa_2	A true warrior needs neither superior tactics nor strong weapons—they need something to protect at all costs. As long as they have that, they will never be defeated.
sm200_spa_3	At times, I remember the past and am saddened. Though long years have passed since then, I remember it as if it were yesterday.
sm200_spa_4	Call on me whenever you need my help.
sm200_spa_max	My friend, your battlefield is also my battlefield. Let us fight together until our lives are spent.
sm201_spa_1	Master, where is...the enemy...\Drooone...
sm201_spa_2	The master's orders must be obeyed! No matter how absurd they are, I will risk my life to carry them out!
sm201_spa_3	You say you wish for friendship, not obedience? I must have misunderstood your command, Master!
sm201_spa_max	I will do anything to please you, Master.
sm202_spa_1	M-Master, if water gets in me, I...won't be...able to...move...
sm202_spa_2	Mech Commander told me not to make a mess of the master's room, even though Master's the one who messed it up in the first place.
sm202_spa_3	Mech Commander says I'm a subordinate, but Master says I'm a friend. Isn't that confusing?
sm202_spa_max	I'm scared of fighting, but if I'm with you, Master, I can overcome it.
sm203_spa_1	Sleep, little baby ♪\I'll see you in your dreams...
sm203_spa_2	Can't you hear it? The trees! The flowers! Even the pebbles on the road! They're all singing.

sm206_spa_1	No one's here... Perfect.\There we go.
sm206_spa_2	Weaklings get eaten. That's just how the world is.
sm206_spa_3	I should be more kind, you say? Haha, don't make me laugh. I'm pretty nice, considering the world we live in.
sm206_spa_max	You don't like this world? Then you should change it. There's nothing you can't do if you put your mind to it. Right?
sm211_spa_1	Always be sure to brush thoroughly!\Get 'em shining like the stars above!
sm211_spa_2	I like Master because he isn't like a demon at all.\Other demons are too cunning...\They're no fun.
sm211_spa_3	I shall always be at the Master's side!\It's fun just watching you.
sm211_spa_max	I am my master's guardian angel, Angel Lot!\I am always watching over him.\I also never miss.\A confused master is an amusing master.
sm212_spa_1	I worked my butt off and now I can hardly move! Huh? Wait, what was I doing?
sm212_spa_2	You came to the hot spring too, demon feline?
sm212_spa_3	The water is probably filthy, but I bet you're cold, so just get in already. Hee hee.
sm212_spa_max	I'll protect you from now on, demon feline. I will be the shield who watches over your undying empire.
sm215_spa_1	Au can picture the Aurora Heart empire now, rora. It was truly a peaceful place, rora.
sm215_spa_2	Warriors need their rest too, rora. But too much rest is bad. You must not forget how to fight, rora.
sm215_spa_3	You cannot avoid battalora. The enemy is everywhere. We must strike first. That is the only way to survive, rora.
sm215_spa_4	Misfortune will ambush you one day, rora. I hope you do not make the same mistakes Au did.
sm215_spa_5	You are a very peaceable demon to hate fighting as you do, rora. Maybe the Infernal Realm needs an Archfiend like you.
sm215_spa_max	Do not hesitate to fight, rora. You will not lose. Now, become as my sword, rora!
sm216_spa_1	Hmph. Why isn't there a Hot Springs Day?
sm216_spa_2	I'm the servant of the blue Santa Claus! I don't have any other master!
sm216_spa_3	Submit to Santa Claus, young demon!
sm216_spa_4	You're not my new master, Demon! But if Santa Claus orders it... Hmmm. Then I won't give it a second thought!
sm216_spa_max	Christmas and demons can never coexist! I'll destroy what opposes me with my own hands! Accept your fate and surrender!
sm217_spa_1	Wait... I want to stay...
sm217_spa_2	I am...the true Rudolph. I came from a cold, wintry land. I wandered all this way...across the snow fields.
sm217_spa_3	I am...Red Nose. I pull...Santa's sleigh. Demon, do you...believe me?
sm217_spa_4	Nicole... Notice me. If you don't see me...I'll disappear.
sm217_spa_max	I am...all alone. Always. I run alone. Demon, can I pull...your sleigh?
sm223_spa_1	No more presents right now...\Don't wake me up!
sm223_spa_2	I'm Santa's Gift Bag! I don't want any demons infected with Christmasitis!
sm223_spa_3	If Santa orders it, I'd swallow a demon like you in one gu— Huh? Do I always do what Santa says? Well, yeah. Duh. That's what it means to be his Gift Bag.
sm223_spa_max	I'm only helping you for Santa's sake! Don't talk to me like we're best buds now.
sm245_spa_1	Wow, you're being so nice to me. Thanks, Demon.
sm245_spa_2	We, Creature, are many and yet one. We gather every day to debate the future.
sm245_spa_3	Our creator abandoned us, but that does not mean we will give up on living. Please guide us in our creator's stead.
sm245_spa_4	You seem to feel sorry for us, as usual, but that is not necessary. Foolish demon... You worry too much. Do not pity us.
sm245_spa_max	Though our forms are different, it does not change the fact that we were born into this world. Though saddled with this monstrous form, we are alive. Do not deny us.
sm255_spa_1	*sigh* This place seems to help people get healthy...and that gets under my skin like nothing else!
sm255_spa_2	You seem healthy, Master. I don't like that. Let me do you a favor and poison you.
sm255_spa_3	You seem tired. Excellent. That means the nutrients I gave you were effective.
sm255_spa_max	Are you sad about something, Master? What excellent news! I feel great now!
sm261_spa_1	The hot spring sure feels good. ...Hey, why the long face, Moa? Smile. Smile, I say!
sm261_spa_2	You say Moa looks lonely? I'm glad that you're worried about my Moa, but...back off.
sm261_spa_3	Not being able to see my friends anymore is...really sad. Like there's a hole in my heart.
sm261_spa_4	Only I'm allowed to love Moa. So why doesn't Moa accept this overflowing affection I have to give?
sm261_spa_5	I lost my friends because I'm weak. Master, please help me get stronger.
sm261_spa_max	There's only room for one Moa in this world. For Moa to remain Moa, one of us has to disappear. But is that really our only choice?
sm264_spa_1	You're a demon. I'm not thanking you\for treating me to a spa day.
sm264_spa_2	I'm not Diablo, I'm Procel.\You better get it right, or I'll swallow you.
sm264_spa_3	I can't believe I renewed my pact with you.\Bah, I still have the bad habits I had when I was Diablo.
sm264_spa_4	I am instinct itself. I'm simple—a mixture of weakness and nasty stuff.\That's what I am.
sm264_spa_5	The red blood that covered me...\I couldn't forget the pain I felt\when I thought I'd been abandoned.\
sm264_spa_max	You don't regret taking me back, do you?\I'm glad to have you back.
